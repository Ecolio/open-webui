      "Structure of the Proposal The proposal contains two parts:•Part A of the proposal is generated by the IT system. It is based on the information entered by the participants through the submission system in the Funding & Tenders Portal. The participants can update the information in the submission system at any time before final submission.  •Part B of the proposal is the narrative part that includes three sections that each correspond to an evaluation criterion. Part B needs to be uploaded as a PDF document following the templates downloaded by the applicants in the submission system for the specific call or topic. The templates for a specific call may slightly differ from the example provided in this document.The electronic submission system is an online wizard that guides you step-by-step through the preparation of your proposal. The submission process consists of 6 steps:- Step 1: Logging in the Portal - Step 2: Select the call, topic and type of action in the Portal- Step 3: Create a draft proposal: Title, acronym, summary, main organisation and contact details- Step 4: Manage your parties and contact details: add your partner organisations and contact details. - Step 5: Edit and complete web forms for proposal part A and upload proposal part B- Step 6: Submit the proposalHISTORY OF CHANGESVersionPublication dateChanges1.010.03.2021―Initial version1.119.04.2021―Formatting and alignment―Clariﬁcation of the indicative number of pages in section 2.2 is for sections 2.2 and 2.3―Added the name of the award criterion in section 31.225.05.2021―Addition of a table in section 3.1 about in-kind contributions2.021.01.2022―Changes in tables on section 3 avoiding duplication of information―Reorder of points in ‘Impact’ section3.011.07.2022―Consolidation, formatting and layout changes.

      "procedure.The structure of this template must be followed when preparing your proposal. It has been designed to ensure that the important aspects of your planned work are presented in a way that will enable the experts to make an effective assessment against the evaluation criteria. Sections 1, 2 and 3 each correspond to an evaluation criterion. Please be aware that proposals will be evaluated as they were submitted, rather than on their potential if certain changes were to be made. This means that only proposals that successfully address all the required aspects will have a chance of being funded. There will be no possibility for significant changes to content, budget and consortium composition during grant preparation. Page limit: The title, list of participants and sections 1, 2 and 3, together, should not be longer than 45 pages. For topics using lump sum funding, the limit is 50 pages. All tables, figures, references and any other element pertaining to these sections must be included as an integral part of these sections and are thus counted against this page limit. The number of pages included in each section of this template is only indicative. The page limit will be applied automatically. At the end of this document you can see the structure of the actual proposal that you need to submit, please remove all instruction pages that are watermarked. If you attempt to upload a proposal longer than the specified limit before the deadline, you will receive an automatic warning and will be advised to shorten and re-upload the proposal. After the deadline, excess pages (in over-long proposals/applications) will be automatically made invisible, and will not be taken into consideration by the experts. The proposal is a self-contained document.  Experts will be instructed to ignore hyperlinks to information that is specifically designed to expand the proposal, thus circumventing the page limit. Please, do not consider the page limit as a target! It is in your interest to keep your text as concise as possible, since experts rarely view unnecessarily long proposals in a positive light. The following formatting conditions apply. The reference font for the body text of proposals is Times New Roman (Windows platforms), Times/Times New Roman (Apple platforms) or Nimbus Roman No. 9 L (Linux distributions).The use of a different font for the body text is not advised and is subject to the cumulative conditions that the font is legible and that its use does not significantly shorten the representation of the proposal in number of pages compared to using the reference font (for example with a view to bypass the page limit).The minimum font size allowed is 11 points. Standard character spacing and a minimum of single line spacing is to be used. This applies to the body text, including text in tables.Text elements other than the body text, such as headers, foot/end notes, captions, formula's, may deviate, but must be legible.The page size is A4, and all margins (top, bottom, left, right) should be at least 15 mm (not including any footers or headers).This document is tagged. Be careful not to delete the tags; they are needed for processing.DEFINITIONS Critical riskA critical risk is a plausible event or issue that could have a high adverse impact on the ability of the project to achieve its objectives.   Level of likelihood to occur (Low/medium/high): The likelihood is the estimated probability that the risk will materialise even after taking account of the mitigating measures put in place.Level of severity (Low/medium/high): The relative seriousness of the risk and the signiﬁcance of its effect.\n",
      "DeliverableA report that is sent to the Commission or Agency providing information to ensure effective monitoring of the project. There are different types of deliverables (e.g. a report on speciﬁc activities or results, data management plans, ethics or security requirements). ImpactsWider long term effects on society (including the environment), the economy and science, enabled by the outcomes of R&I investments (long term). It refers to the speciﬁc contribution of the project to the work programme expected impacts described in the destination. Impacts generally occur some time after the end of the project.Example: The deployment of the advanced forecasting system enables each airport to increase maximum passenger capacity by 15% and passenger average throughput by 10%, leading to a 28% reduction in infrastructure expansion costs.MilestoneControl points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the achievement of a key result, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development. The achievement of a milestone should be veriﬁable.ObjectivesThe goals of the work performed within the project, in terms of its research and innovation content. This will be translated into the project’s results. These may range from tackling speciﬁc research questions, demonstrating the feasibility of an innovation, sharing knowledge among stakeholders on speciﬁc issues. The nature of the objectives will depend on the type of action, and the scope of the topic.OutcomesThe expected effects, over the medium term, of projects supported under a given topic.  The results of a project should contribute to these outcomes, fostered in particular by the dissemination and exploitation measures. This may include the uptake, diffusion, deployment, and/or use of the project’s results by direct target groups. Outcomes generally occur during or shortly after the end of the project.Example: 9 European airports adopt the advanced forecasting system demonstrated during the project.Pathway to impact Logical steps towards the achievement of the expected impacts of the project over time, in particular beyond the duration of a project. A pathway begins with the projects’ results, to their dissemination, exploitation and communication, contributing to the expected outcomes in the work programme topic, and ultimately to the wider scientiﬁc, economic and societal impacts of the work programme destination. Research  outputResults generated by the action to which access can be given in the form of scientiﬁc publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes such as software, algorithms, protocols and electronic notebooks.ResultsWhat is generated during the project implementation. This may include, for example, know-how, innovative solutions, algorithms, proof of feasibility, new business models, policy recommendations, guidelines, prototypes, demonstrators, databases and datasets, trained researchers, new infrastructures, networks, etc. Most project results (inventions, scientiﬁc works, etc.) are ‘Intellectual Property’, which may, if appropriate, be protected by formal ‘Intellectual Property Rights’.Example: Successful large-scale demonstrator: trial with 3 airports of an advanced forecasting system for proactive airport passenger ﬂow management.Technology Readiness LevelSee Work Programme General Annexes B\n",

      "1. Excellence #@REL-EVA-RE@#Excellence – aspects to be taken into account.−Clarity and pertinence of the project’s objectives, and the extent to which the proposed work is ambitious, and goes beyond the state of the art.−Soundness of the proposed methodology, including the underlying concepts, models, assumptions, interdisciplinary approaches, appropriate consideration of the gender dimension in research and innovation content, and the quality of open science practices, including sharing and management of research outputs and engagement of citizens, civil society and end users where appropriate.The following aspects will be taken into account only to the extent that the proposed work is within the scope of the work programme topic.1.1 Objectives and ambition #@PRJ-OBJ-PO@# [e.g. 4 pages]•Brieﬂy describe the objectives of your proposed work. Why are they pertinent to the work programme topic? Are they measurable and veriﬁable? Are they realistically achievable?•Describe how your project goes beyond the state-of-the-art, and the extent the proposed work is ambitious. Indicate any exceptional ground-breaking R&I, novel concepts and approaches, new products, services or business and organisational models. Where relevant, illustrate the advance by referring to products and services already available on the market. Refer to any patent or publication search carried out.•Describe where the proposed work is positioned in terms of R&I maturity (i.e. where it is situated in the spectrum from ‘idea to application’, or from ‘lab to market’). Where applicable, provide an indication of the Technology Readiness Level, if possible distinguishing the start and by the end of the project.Please bear in mind that advances beyond the state of the art must be interpreted in the light of the positioning of the project. Expectations will not be the same for RIAs at lower TRL, compared with Innovation Actions at high TRLs. #§PRJ-OBJ-PO§#1.2 Methodology #@CON-MET-CM@# #@COM-PLE-CP@# [e.g. 14 pages]•Describe and explain the overall methodology, including the concepts, models and assumptions that underpin your work. Explain how this will enable you to deliver your project’s objectives. Refer to any important challenges you may have identiﬁed in the chosen methodology and how you intend to overcome them. [e.g. 10  pages]This section should be presented as a narrative. The detailed tasks and work packages are described below under ‘Implementation’. Where relevant, include how the project methodology complies with the ‘do no signiﬁcant harm’ principle as per Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (i.e. the so-called 'EU Taxonomy Regulation'). This means that the methodology is designed in a way it is not signiﬁcantly harming any of the six environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.If you plan to use, develop and/or deploy artiﬁcial intellingence (AI) based systems and/or techniques you must demonstrate their technical robustness. AI-based systems or techniques should be, or be developed to become: •technically robust, accurate and reproducible, and able to deal with and inform about possible failures, inaccuracies and errors, proportionate to the assessed risk they pose •socially robust, in that they duly consider the context and environment in which \n",
      "they operate •reliable and function as intended, minimizing unintentional and unexpected harm, preventing unacceptable harm and safeguarding the physical and mental integrity of humans •able to provide a suitable explanation of their decision-making processes, whenever they can have a signiﬁcant impact on people’s lives.•Describe any national or international research and innovation activities whose results will feed into the project, and how that link will be established; [e.g. 1 page]•Explain how expertise and methods from different disciplines will be brought together and integrated in pursuit of your objectives. If you consider that an inter-disciplinary approach is unnecessary in the context of the proposed work, please provide a justiﬁcation. [e.g. 1/2 page]•For topics where the work programme indicates the need for the integration of social sciences and humanities, show the role of these disciplines in the project or provide a justiﬁcation if you consider that these disciplines are not relevant to your proposed project. [e.g. 1/2 page]•Describe how the gender dimension (i.e. sex and/or gender analysis) is taken into account in the project’s research and innovation content [e.g. 1 page]. If you do not consider such a gender dimension to be relevant in your project, please provide a justiﬁcation.  Note: This section is mandatory except for topics which have been identiﬁed in the work programme as not requiring the integration of the gender dimension into R&I content.Remember that that this question relates to the content of the planned research and innovation activities, and not to gender balance in the teams in charge of carrying out the project.Sex and gender analysis refers to biological characteristics and social/cultural factors respectively. For guidance on methods of sex / gender analysis and the issues to be taken into account, please refer to https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/gendered-innovations-2-2020-nov-24_en•Describe how appropriate open science practices are implemented as an integral part of the proposed methodology. Show how the choice of practices and their implementation are adapted to the nature of your work, in a way that will increase the chances of the project delivering on its objectives [e.g. 1 page]. If you believe that none of these practices are appropriate for your project, please provide a justiﬁcation here. Open science is an approach based on open cooperative work and systematic sharing of knowledge and tools as early and widely as possible in the process. Open science practices include early and open sharing of research (for example through preregistration, registered reports, pre-prints, or crowd-sourcing); research output management; measures to ensure reproducibility of research outputs; providing open access to research outputs (such as publications, data, software, models, algorithms, and workﬂows); participation in open peer-review; and involving all relevant knowledge actors including citizens, civil society and end users in the co-creation of R&I agendas and contents (such as citizen science).Please note that this question does not refer to outreach actions that may be planned as part of communication, dissemination and exploitation activities. These aspects should instead be described below under ‘Impact’.•Research data management and management of other research outputs: Applicants generating/collecting data and/or other research outputs (except for publications) during the project must provide maximum 1 page on how the data/ research outputs will be managed in line with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), addressing the following \n",
      "(the description should be speciﬁc to your project): [1 page]Types of data/research outputs (e.g. experimental, observational, images, text, numerical) and their estimated size; if applicable, combination with, and provenance of, existing data.Findability of data/research outputs: Types of persistent and unique identiﬁers (e.g. digital object identiﬁers) and trusted repositories that will be used.Accessibility of data/research outputs: IPR considerations and timeline for open access (if open access not provided, explain why); provisions for access to restricted data for veriﬁcation purposes.Interoperability of data/research outputs: Standards, formats and vocabularies for data and metadata.Reusability of data/research outputs:  Licenses for data sharing and re-use (e.g. Creative Commons, Open Data Commons); availability of tools/software/models for data generation and validation/interpretation /re-use.Curation and storage/preservation costs; person/team responsible for data management and quality assurance. Proposals selected for funding under Horizon Europe will need to develop a detailed data management plan (DMP) for making their data/research outputs ﬁndable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) as a deliverable by month 6 and revised towards the end of a project’s lifetime. For guidance on open science practices and research data management, please refer to the relevant section of the HE Programme Guide on the Funding & Tenders Portal.#@CON-MET-CM@# #@COM-PLE-CP@#2. Impact #@IMP-ACT-IA@#Impact – aspects to be taken into account.−Credibility of the pathways to achieve the expected outcomes and impacts speciﬁed in the work programme, and the likely scale and signiﬁcance of the contributions due to the project.−Suitability and quality of the measures to maximise expected outcomes and impacts, as set out in the dissemination and exploitation plan, including communication activities.The results of your project should make a contribution to the expected outcomes set out for the work programme topic over the medium term, and to the wider expected impacts set out in the ‘destination’ over the longer term. In this section you should show how your project could contribute to the outcomes and impacts described in the work programme, the likely scale and signiﬁcance of this contribution, and the measures to maximise these impacts.2.1 Project’s pathways towards impact [e.g. 4 pages]•Provide a narrative explaining how the project’s results are expected to make a difference in terms of impact, beyond the immediate scope and duration of the project. The narrative should include the components below, tailored to your project. \n",
      "(a) Describe the unique contribution your project results would make towards (1) the outcomes speciﬁed in this topic, and (2) the wider impacts, in the longer term, speciﬁed in the respective destinations in the work programme.   Be speciﬁc, referring to the effects of your project, and not R&I in general in this ﬁeld. State the target groups that would beneﬁt. Even if target groups are mentioned in general terms in the work programme, you should be speciﬁc here, breaking target groups into particular interest groups or segments of society relevant to this project.The outcomes and impacts of your project may:•Scientiﬁc, e.g. contributing to speciﬁc scientiﬁc advances, across and within disciplines, creating new knowledge, reinforcing scientiﬁc equipment and instruments,  computing systems (i.e. research infrastructures);•Economic/technological, e.g. bringing new products, services, business processes to the market, increasing efﬁciency, decreasing costs, increasing proﬁts, contributing to standards’ setting,  etc. •Societal , e.g. decreasing CO2 e m i s s i o n s ,  d e c r e a s i n g  a v o i d a b l e  m o r t a l i t y ,  improving policies and decision making, raising consumer awareness.Only include such outcomes and impacts where your project would make a signiﬁcant and direct contribution. Avoid describing very tenuous links to wider impacts. However, include any potential negative environmental outcome or impact of the project including when expected results are brought at scale (such as at commercial level). Where relevant, explain how the potential harm can be managed.(b)  Give an indication of the scale and signiﬁcance of the project’s contribution to the expected outcomes and impacts, should the project be successful.  Provide quantiﬁed estimates where possible and meaningful.‘Scale’ refers to how widespread the outcomes and impacts are likely to be. For example, in terms of the size of the target group, or the proportion of that group, that should beneﬁt over time; ‘Signiﬁcance’ refers to the importance, or value, of those beneﬁts. For example, number of additional healthy life years; efﬁciency savings in energy supply.Explain your baselines, benchmarks and assumptions used for those estimates. Wherever possible, quantify your estimation of the effects that you expect from your project. Explain assumptions that you make, referring for example to any relevant studies or statistics. Where appropriate, try to use only one methodology for calculating your estimates: not different methodologies for each partner, region or country (the extrapolation should preferably be prepared by one partner).Your estimate must relate to this project only - the effect of other initiatives should not be taken into account.(c) Describe any requirements and potential barriers - arising from factors beyond the scope and duration of the project - that may determine whether the desired outcomes and impacts are achieved. These may include, for example, other R&I work within and beyond Horizon Europe; regulatory environment; targeted markets; user behaviour. Indicate if these factors might evolve over time. Describe any mitigating measures you propose, within or beyond your project, that could be needed should your assumptions prove to be wrong, or to address identiﬁed barriers. Note that this does not include the critical risks inherent to the management of the project itself , which should be described below under ‘Implementation’.\n",
      "2.2 Measures to maximise impact - Dissemination, exploitation and communication #@COM-DIS-VIS-CDV@# [e.g. 5 pages, including section 2.3]•Describe the planned measures to maximise the impact of your project by providing a ﬁrst version of your ‘plan for the dissemination and exploitation including communication activities’. Describe the dissemination, exploitation and communication measures that are planned, and the target group(s) addressed (e.g. scientiﬁc community, end users, ﬁnancial actors, public at large). Please remember that this plan is an admissibility condition, unless the work programme topic explicitly states otherwise. In case your proposal is selected for funding, a more detailed ‘plan for dissemination and exploitation including communication activities’ will need to be provided as a mandatory project deliverable within 6 months after signature date. This plan shall be periodically updated in alignment with the project’s progress. Communication measures should promote the project throughout the full lifespan of the project. The aim is to inform and reach out to society and show the activities performed, and the use and the beneﬁts the project will have for citizens. Activities must be strategically planned, with clear objectives, start at the outset and continue through the lifetime of the project. The description of the communication activities needs to state the main messages as well as the tools and channels that will be used to reach out to each of the chosen target groups.All measures should be proportionate to the scale of the project, and should contain concrete actions to be implemented both during and after the end of the project, e.g. standardisation activities. Your plan should give due consideration to the possible follow-up of your project, once it is ﬁnished. In the justiﬁcation, explain why each measure chosen is best suited to reach the target group addressed. Where relevant, and for innovation actions, in particular, describe the measures for a plausible path to commercialise the innovations.If exploitation is expected primarily in non-associated third countries, justify by explaining how that exploitation is still in the Union’s interest.Describe possible feedback to policy measures generated by the project that will contribute to designing, monitoring, reviewing and rectifying (if necessary) existing policy and programmatic measures or shaping and supporting the implementation of new policy initiatives and decisions.•Outline your strategy for the management of intellectual property, foreseen protection measures, such as patents, design rights, copyright, trade secrets, etc., and how these would be used to support exploitation.If your project is selected, you will need an appropriate consortium agreement to manage (amongst other things) the ownership and access to key knowledge (IPR, research data etc.). Where relevant, these will allow you, collectively and individually, to pursue market opportunities arising from the project.If your project is selected, you must indicate the owner(s) of the results (results ownership list) in the ﬁnal periodic report.#§COM-DIS-VIS-CDV§#2.3 Summary Provide a summary of this section by presenting in the canvas below the key elements of your project impact pathway and of the measures to maximise its impact.KEY ELEMENT OF THE IMPACT SECTION\n",
      "SPECIFIC NEEDSWhat are the speciﬁc needs that triggered this project?Example 1Most airports use process ﬂow-oriented models based on static mathematical values limiting the optimal management of passenger ﬂow and hampering the accurate use of the available resources to the actual demand of passengers.Example 2Electronic components need to get smaller and lighter to match the expectations of the end-users. At the same time there is a problem of sourcing of raw materials that has an environmental impact. D & E & C MEASURESWhat dissemination, exploitation and communication measures will you apply to the results? Example 1Exploitation: Patenting the algorithmic model. Dissemination towards the scientiﬁc community and airports: Scientiﬁc publication with the results of the large-scale demonstration. Communication towards citizens: An event in a shopping mall to show how the outcomes of the action are relevant to our everyday lives.Example 2Exploitation of the new product:  Patenting the new product;Licencing to major electronic companies. Dissemination towards the scientiﬁc community and industry: Participating at conferences; Developing a platform of material compositions for industry; Participation at EC project portfolios to disseminate the results as part of a group and maximise the visibility vis-à-vis companies.EXPECTED RESULTS\n",

This tableau is indicative of a “wicked problem”: on one hand, \\nconservation efforts have resulted in the flourishing of wild animal populations (including predatory carnivores), but \\non the other hand, farmers and herders have been facing livestock damages and economic loss. Th us, EU’s farm -to-\\nfork and biodiversity 2030 strat egies have in effect led  to increased  agriculture -wildlife conflicts (AWCs)  and \\npolarization amongst stakehol ders, which have resulted in :  \\n- Accelerat ed loss of cultural farming heritage : attrition of traditional outdoor farming activities due to small \\nfarmers’ difficulty in mobilizing  the economic but also time resources to successfully manage conflicts with \\nwildlife.   \\n- Growing risk for illegal killing  of LCs: due to negative, fearful perceptions of and attitudes towards large \\ncarnivores both in areas of continued presence of these carnivores and areas where they have reappeared.   \\nAWC s are often  conceptualized as a two -party conflict , pitting  agro-pastoral communities and their livestock against \\nwildlife management and large carnivores. “Conflict” as such, is mitigated in various ways across Europe , with \\ndivergences that hinge on the  cultural , econ omic , and legislative circumstances in the country and region in question. \\nThis poses challenges with regards  to monitoring data on wildlife conservation and livestock- wildlife encounters, as \\nmethods for collecting data depend on local legi slation . Although there have been international and European efforts \\nto collaborate and share knowledge to adequately design mitigation policies, there is still insufficient knowledge of \\ntheir effect at the local (farm) level.   \\nMany good technical, infrastructural , and economic solutions have been developed to protect outdoors livestock, or \\notherwise equip farmers and conservation actors , including enclosures for free -ranging systems and electric fences \\nfor pastures, cameras and GPS  monitoring og wildlife movement,  or compensating for damages from predation of \\nlarge carnivores.  However, the adoption and implementation of these solutions often face failure - and thus \\ninsufficient effectiveness, due to a combination of different hum an factors, notably:    \\n- Negative preconceptions and attitudes towards other stakeholders  (e.g., farmers vs. conservationists, \\nhunters vs. advocates of animal protection ) hinder ing coordination among all the involved actors. These \\npreconceptions and attitudes emerge from factors at individual, social as well as cultural level, harmful \\nimages, and narratives, e.g.  relative to  both large carnivore s and other stakeholders, preclud ing constructive \\ncommunication and effective decision -making.  \\n- Inadequate dialogue between stakeholders might result in insufficient, incomplete, or incorrect \\ninformation which hinders optimal decision- making both on individual stakeholders’ sides and at broader, \\nregional, national, or European levels. I nadequate dialogue creates the feeling among local stakeholders of \\npolicy decisions being made without considering different stakeholders’ interests , and  how this may lead to \\nlarger co nflicts both among human actors and with nature. It tends to  result  in a farmer s’ lack of trus t in \\ngovernmental bodies, and particularly EU (environmental) policies , as recurrent farmer demonstrations \\nacross the EU  highlight . \\nVarious projects and initiatives have been in part successful in locally  resolving these issues (see ‘R&I activities  \\nfeeding into the project’ s methodology ). Examples from individual local contexts indicate that AWCs  can be \\nmitigated through in- depth dialogue with all invol ved stakeholders to b etter address their needs and challenges. \\nSuccessful  approaches share an ability to generate the  willingness to engage with the Other in a way that improves \\ncoordination between stakeholders , enabl ing the successful adoption and implementation of conflict mitigation \\nstrategies.  But a s encouraging as these individual, geographically scattered examples are, we lack a wide -ranging \\nand successful aggregation of solutions at the  European level.  \\nCohabitation and optimal Reconciliation: Integr ating Territorial Transformations and E cological Resilience , \\n(CRITTER ) posits  that agriculture -wildlife conflicts (AWCs) constitute a complex , multifaceted , and polarizing set \\nof problem s that require carefully and systematically  crafted  interventions  of a multi -actor and multidisciplinary \\napproach .

Nature ’s resources have been  harnessed for prosperity, which has led to resource depletion, habitat loss, and \\nclimate change. Balancing these impacts with our well- being remains a challenge . \\nAn acute instance of this dilemma between nature use s and conservation has emerged in Europe at the meeting point \\nof outdoo r agricultural systems and the co nservation of large carnivores. Resolving this dilemma has traditionally \\nbeen approached from the angle of conflict prevention and management  (CPM) . Yet despite valuable efforts for \\nimproving CPM, academic as well as field experience indicate that a deeper change in human relationships with \\nnature may be required . This project ’s ambition is to induce a paradigm shift in approaching  encounters \\nbetween outdoor agricultural systems and large carnivores , moving beyond CPM to  enhancing  cohabitation \\nbetween multiple Human as well as Other -than -Human stakeholders .  \\nPredominant  Conflict P reventi on & Management  approaches and their drawbacks \\nThe challenges arising from the encounter s of outdoor agricultural systems and large carnivores ha ve been the focus \\nof a plethora of studies, projects and initiatives across Europe, focused  on CPM  (or variations thereof ), with a n \\nemphasis on human- wildlife conflict resolution . Historically, local populations across Europe drew on  traditional \\nknowledge for CPM , but such knowledge has largely disappeared throughout  the twentieth century , which along  with \\na shifte d focus towards  the conservation of large carni vores has significantly changed farmers’  possibilities to \\nmitigate  challenges associated with increasing carnivore populations5. Conservation concerns have largely  instigated  \\na shift from lethal, eradication -based solutions to non-lethal CPM  solutions such as  (electric) fences, deterrents and \\nother early warning systems, monitoring systems, livestock- guarding dogs, herdsmen  and zoning management \\nsystems, although se lective culling complements these non- lethal solutions. Monetary/non- monetary compensations \\nand incentives also constitute an important element of such CPM6. Despite their importance , we identify four \\ninterconnected drawbacks relative  to these CPM solutions: \\nA. Insufficient attention on local stakeholders’ needs and challenges for CPM. \\nSuccessful im plementation of CPM demands substantial  time and financial investment: it requires  organisational, \\ntechnical, and economic changes , and for  farmers to modify well -established practices of livestock and grazing \\nmanagement . Small- scale farmers are e specially challenged  when  implementing such solutions  despite financial \\nincentives. These indirect costs of mitigation measures are often not compensated in initiatives such as the CAP Rural \\nDevelopment Plans7. Limited peer -reviewed scientific research has investigated different livestock farming systems’ \\npotential (from high to nil) to implement “standard” damage prevention measures , even if valuable field -level action \\nhas taken place in the past  for resolving this issue8. However, there is limited understanding of livestock farming \\nsystems’ highly variable possibility to fulfil the consequent needs to labour and modifying their livestock and grazing management practices. What needs to be studied is therefore not simply the prevention measures, but the complex \\ninterface of  prevention measures  with livestock systems, smallholders , and part time farmers as key stakeholders  \\nrequiring specific focus.   \\nB. Insufficient focus on goodwill and dialogue between (and among) local and regional stakeholders  \\nCPM hinges on t he goodwill of local stakeholders as well as the severity of  sanctions towards illegal ly killing  large \\ncarnivores\\n9.

On the affective level, emotions such as fear or admiration play a prominent role in stakeholders’ \\npolarization of attitudes11. As a consequence, m uch effort on debunking incorrect facts or changing individual \\nattitudes  regarding LC often prove unsuccessful or even counter -productive, generating heightened resistance to \\ndialogue rather than a fact -based, respectful discussion of conflicting viewpoints , not least as stakeholders such as \\nfarming communities might distrust such initiatives when they originat e from  nature conservation institutions.  When \\nCPM is seen as a predominantly technological or biological problem solved by rational cost -benefit asse ssments, the \\nemotional, s patial , and cultural dimensions of interactions  between humans and wildlife thus risk being \\ndeprioritized12. As LC are a very sentimental issue both for residents and practitioners resisting their penetration to \\ntheir neighbourhood s, and for actor s pursuing their preservation, it is essential for CPM to enable convivial dialogues  \\nto assess the diverse values , emotions, and needs of stakeholders and other actors, an aspect not given sufficient \\nattention previously. Socio -demographic factors such as gender or c lass, as well as cultural factors such as subcultural \\nclashes (e.g. environmental or hunting cultures13) have shown to further influence the valence of individuals’ attitudes \\ntowards large carnivores14.Finally, the number and type of stakeholders’ direct interactions with large carnivores \\nappear to shape these stakeholders’ attitudes, where direct experiences and close proximity with large carnivores can \\nnegatively impact stakeholders’  attitudes15 and on the other hand continuous close contact between humans and large  \\ncarnivores, such close proximity leads to increased tolerance of LC  and support for their conservation16. These factors \\nneed to be brought t ogether for successfully a ddressing  the encounter of agricultural and wil dlife.  \\nC. Inadequa cy of Conflict as a foundational concept  \\nA growing number of studies argue that one of the main obstacles to successful CPM lies in a misinterpretation of  \\nthe concept of conflict17 between humans and LC . On one hand, conflict is inadequately defined. W hat is presented \\nas a human vs . animal conflict is  in most cases a human v s. human conflict, where opposing viewpoints are \\ninsufficiently acknowledged and res olved . Conflicts among farmers, environmentalists, authorities , and local \\npopulations  tend to lie at the core of the unsuccessful management of agriculture- wildlife conflicts. It is th erefore  \\ncrucial to distinguish human–wildlife impacts from  human–human conflicts18. This issue intersects with drawback \\n(B) above. Despite their advantages, technological solutions are insufficient for adequately resolving agriculture -\\nwildlife conflict s if the human -human, social and cultural conflicts arising in agriculture -wildlife  encounters  are not \\nconsidered as aspects of CPM19. In our view even more importantly, approaching the complex encounters and \\ninteractions  between multiple Human and Other -than-Human sta keholders predominantly through the lens of conflict \\nsets the stage for  failure , especially when  parties in the encounter perceive each other  as conscious (human) \\nantagonists20 who harm other stakeholders’ wellbeing with ill -guided intent . Framing human- wildlife interactions as \\nintrinsically conflict -laden erroneously suggests that coexistence is only possible in the absence of any conflict21. \\nOur ambition in this project is to offer a comprehensive set of tools, methods and processes alleviating these \\n \\n10 Franchini M, Corazzin M, Bovolenta S, Filacorda S.

To do so, this project embeds the development and improvement of CPM tools and \\ntechnologies in a holistic, multi- stakeholder framework enhancing  cohabitation  by enhancing understanding, \\ndialogue, and coordination between and among stakeholders at local and regional level. A cohabitation- focused \\nframework cannot ignore dam ages, risks and other challenges arising in these encounters but brings beneficial and \\ndetrimenta l aspects into dialogue for allowing stakeholders to surpa ss challenges in the most constructive way22.  \\nD. Heterogenous and/or inadequate data quality regarding livestock -wildlife encounters and damages  \\nPublic monitoring of predator management, implementation of damage prevention measures, and associated costs \\n(for farmers a nd society through support and compensation measures) are heterogeneous and fragmented a cross  \\nEuropean countries and regions . Access to information is also difficult within and across countries and regions. There \\nis a need for harm onization  and improvement  of available information , including relevant information on farming \\nsystems and related management practices.  \\nPromising results from dialogue -based solutions  but lacking  scalability  \\nA small, but growing number of projects feature similar ambitions to the ones in the present project23. Besides \\ncontrolling the  encounter of  wildlife and livestock, some initiatives increasingly  pay attention to the human-human \\nconflicts which may arise because of wild life-livestock interactions. In many countries, discussion forums have for \\ninstance been established to ventilate the different values and needs of stakeholders and other actors. But d espite \\noffering promising results, such  projects have remained  context -specific, and do not provide actionable avenues for \\nscaling the methodologies adopted i n these projects to a broade r, European level. Anecdotal evidence suggest s that \\nsuch dialogue -based  approaches  to conflict resolution and management work be st at the local level as the issues at \\nhand can be very personal to local residents. While regional and EU -level platforms exist, the latter t end to be strongly \\nfocused on political debate, which local -level stakeholders are wary of. Other  existing conventions and networks \\n(Council of Europe Bern Convention, EU Habitats Directive, Emerald, Natura 2000) aim at improving cross-border \\ncoordination, but individual nations’ implementation o f these conventions is poor. Instead of introducing a n \\nadditional European- level political platform, CRITTER deliver s a diverse toolbox for decisionmakers  to optimally \\ninvolve stakeholders at the local level, while allowing local stakeholders’ experiences to be shared across contexts . \\nDoing so is crucial for enhancing  cohabitation between agriculture and wildlife due to the wide -ranging movement \\nof large carnivores. Our ambi tion in this project is to provide actionable recommendations targeting policy - \\nand other decision -makers which allow them to en hance  cohabitation at the wider European level . We expect  \\nthat these recommendations will  remain  context-dependent to some extent . They  do not aim at homogenizing TTM  \\nadopted across contexts, but delineate a combination of tools, methods , and processes to be implemented a cross \\nEuropean countries, conducive to improve understanding, dialogue and coordination, and thus ultimately decision-\\nmaking  between stakeho lders at local and regional level.  \\nShifting the  paradigm towards multispecies cohabitation  \\nBased on the insights and considerations detailed above, CRITTER’s  \\nambition  is to induce a deep-re aching paradigm shift in approaching \\nthe encounter of Human and Other -than- Human beings specifically \\nwhen it comes to the meeting  points between  agriculture  and large \\ncarnivores.  \\nThe proposed paradigm shift enables local, regional, national as well as \\nEuropean- level decision makers to adopt a systematized and harmonized \\napproach to ma naging the encounter between agriculture and large \\ncarnivores. It promotes a change of focus towards a cohabitation between \\nmultiple human and other -than-human beings in a way that acknowledges \\nthe complex entanglement of benefits and challenges in this co habitation, \\nbut where the former do not cancel out the latter or vice versa. To attain such \\na form of cohabitation, CRITTER adds to existing practice with a set of systemati zed participatory methods accessible to decision -makers at different policy levels, which involve, respect , \\nand valorise local stakeholders’ contrasting realities (multistakeholder lifeworlds  as defi ned below), and thereby \\nfacilitate constructive decision -making.  \\n \\n22 Boonman- Berson S, Turnhout E, Carolan M.

However , when approached from the theoretical angle of Multispecies \\nRelations Studies, cohabitation is not to be seen as free of wildlife -induced damages or conflicts between (human) \\nstakeholders. To the contrary, cohabitation represents a messy s et of interactions, where outcomes detrimental to \\nsome or all parties are not minimized, but where the different stakeholders’ unique realities are acknowledged and respected as valuable contributions to complex ecosystems , as actors being encouraged to take an orientation towards \\ndeveloping long- lasting solution s\\n24.  \\n \\nFigure 2 Natu reCultural Paradigm shift in CPM  \\nDefinitions  \\nNatureCulture  ContactZones (NCCZ)  The project coins the concept of NatureCulture  Contact Zones  (NCCZ) \\nto reframe the theoretical and empirical site of Human/Other -than- Human encounters, defining NCCZ as  real and \\nimagined meeting points between species, where the interactions and intersections between and among these species \\nare consciously acknowledged along with the challenges emerging from these interactions and intersecti ons, and the \\ninequalities which may ari se in the resolution of these challenges.  \\nNatureCulture25 questions dichotomies suc h as nature -culture, subject -object or human -nonhuman that have \\ndominated Western philosophical traditions. NatureCulture  highlights that “ nature ” and “ culture ” are mutually \\ndependent and constitutive rather than mutually exclusive. Landscapes, (agricultural) practices or human \\nagglomerations are constituted in interactions between human and “other -than-human\" beings, rather than in \\nopposition to them. Framing  the problem at hand from a perspective where multiple human and other -than-human \\nstakeholders’ needs are approached as interdependent and intersecting  then means that  resolving the challenges \\ninherent to these intersections requires moving beyond categories that rigidify antagonist understandings of other \\nstakeholders. The project combines the concept of NatureCulture with the concept of contact zone26, describing a \\ndiversity of relations between different subjects, creating an assemblage shaped by histori cal, cultural, ecological , \\nand evolutionary conditions.  When human and other -than-human subjects are present and interact in contact zones \\nthey are constituted in and by their relations to each other; a process often exhibiting asymmetrical relations of \\npower27.  \\nMultistakeholder Lifeworlds (MLW)  The epistemological commitment of this theoretical approach lies in focusing \\non situated knowledge , producing localized knowledge that appreciates NatureCulture particularities of the empirical \\nzone in question.

The concept of “lifeworld” is broadly used in \\nsociological and anthropological research. Initially coined by Husserl, this concept nowadays refers to “ a person\\'s \\nsubjective construction of reality, whi ch he or she forms under the condi tion of his or her life circumstances”28. \\nLifeworlds reflect the respective realities stakeholders evolve in, which not only build on factual information but \\ntend to combine facts with individualized priorities, preferences, needs and challenges as well as socio -cultural \\nnarratives and stories. Stakeholders’ lifeworlds can thus widely differ, a same encounter between agriculture and \\ncarnivores being understood in dramatically different ways among stakeholders. \\n(Mul tispecies) Cohabitation  A growing number of studies about the encounter between agriculture and wildlife \\nconservation highlight the need for transitioning from a conflict - to a cohabitation- focused approach29. This approach \\nrelies on decentring the agency of humans and acknowledging the interactive and mutually constitutive character of \\nlandscapes30. Such a focus on cohabitation has a natural compatibility with M ultispecies Relations Studies , in that \\nthe la tter’s focus likewise lies on decentring the human, moving societal as well as aca demic attention away from \\nanthropocentric perspectives towards perspectives acknowledging the inextricable co- constitution of ecosystems and \\nthe interdependency of humans and other- than-humans.   \\nBeyond its contributions for field -level problem resolution or mitigation, the concepts which this project coins offer \\nseveral contributions to existing academic knowledge . The introduction and application of the concept of NCCZ  \\ncontributes to academic research by coining a theoretical concept that allows to qualif y and approach challenging \\nencounters between Human and Other -than-Human societies across disciplines. A fundamental novelty inherent to \\nadopting the Nature Culture  concept  as foundational to this project  when it comes to  the encounters between \\nagriculture and wildlife conservation is that it includes farmers and their organisations not as beneficiaries of \\nmeasures, but as active participants along with other human and other -than-human stakeholders in the co- creation of \\nthe conditions and measures to enhance  the cohabitation of human and other -than-human species in their contexts. \\nDoing so allows for bringing forward stakeholders ’ lived realities via MLW  and addressing these realities without \\ndismiss ing their  emotional, cultural, or practical specificities. This project also advances existing research and \\npractices by treating contact zones  as sites where not only different species, but also different disciplines come \\ntogether. Such an extended conceptualization of contact zones as multispecies and multidisciplinary sites enables us \\nto capitalize the potential emerging from the NatureCulture  approach we advocate in the project. On an \\ninterdisciplinary level, the use and integration of SSH concepts such  as NCCZ , MLW  and multispecies cohabi tation  \\nin resolving problematic encounters between agriculture and wildlife represents a potential scientific breakthrough \\nfor proliferating studies of multispecies relations among technical and natural scientific disciplines .  \\n1.1.3 Research and innovation positioning \\nPROJECT COMPONENTS & INNOVATIONS  TRL  START \\uf0c0 END \\nTools, technologie s and management pr ocesses fo r enhanced agriculture/LC cohabit ation  \\n(TTM ) 4 \\uf0e0 6 \\nDigital twin  technology applied  to human -wildlife encounter  monitoring  4 \\uf0e0 6 \\nNatureCulture Collaboration Hub  (NC2 Hub) 3 \\uf0e0 6 \\nDataset of benefits and disadvantages  (“costs ”) of developed/improved  TTM 3 \\uf0e0 7 \\nAn inventory of best practices  for enhanced agriculture/LC cohabit ation  3 \\uf0e0 7 \\nCo-learning & participatory decision -making  modules  (NC2 modules)  4 \\uf0e0 7 \\n#§PRJ -OBJ-PO§# \\n1.2 Methodology #@CON- MET -CM@# #@COM -PLE-CP@#  \\nThe methodology unfolds the project’s paradigm -shifting ambition by taking the framework of human- wildlife \\nencounters in NCCZ as both its theoretical and empirical point of departure, leveraging a multi -stakeholder approach.   \\nOn the theoretical  level, the proposed framework allows the project to tackle the complexity inherent to the \\nencounters between different human stakeholders, livestock and carnivores and their embeddedness in broader social \\n \\n28 Kraus B jörn Kraus: The Life We Live and the Life We Experience: Introducing the Epistemological Difference between \"Lifeworld\" (Lebenswelt) and \"Life \\nConditions\" (Lebenslage) Social Work and Society.

It does so by highlighting the dependencies, relationalities, and entanglements inherent to various  \\ncreatures coming into contact. The NCCZ framework recognizes the ability of human and OH species to effect \\nchanges in their environments, to interact with and shape the actio ns of other beings, and to shape social and scientific \\nknowledge and practices. Thereby, the project’s theoretical focus moves beyond dichotomic, conflict -based \\napproaches and towards allowing the multiplicity of needs, chal lenges, and priorities among stakeholders to be taken \\ninto consideration, and where relevant leveraged.  \\nIn line w ith the ‘ situated knowledge’ epistemology adopted for the study of MLWs, this project also approaches \\nNCCZ as empirical sites  that allow it to access and explore human -livestock -predator contacts in Nature Culturally  \\ndiverse settings across Europe. Differences in lifeworlds can hinder effective engagement in constructive dialogue \\nwhen other stakeholders are perceived as opponents in a conflict between parties, and their needs are deprioritized in \\nrelation to one’s own needs. This project works with, rather  than aga inst the existence of multiple lifeworlds in NCCZ \\nby developing methods and processes that allow stakeholders to collaboratively uproot conflict -generative images, \\nimaginations and narratives while acknowledg ing and respecting multiple stakeholders’ lifeworlds.  \\nA project built on iterative, in -depth multistakeholder involvement  \\nThe project involves relevant stakeholders throughout the project pe riod, at the local, regional, national as well as \\nEuropean level. Specifically, we engage stakeholders through:  \\n- In-depth ethnographic and participatory empirical  research  in preparation of as well as during the living labs’ \\nrunning periods, focused on delineating stakeholders’ realities, needs, challenges and lifeworlds (local, regional & \\nnational stakeholder levels)  \\n- An empirical quantitative study  in close collaboration with local farmers, herders , and small landowners to define \\ncosts and benefits related to current and new farming strategies that preserve, protect , and valorise wildlife and \\npastoralism. Results are validated by regional administrators involved in rural development planning (local & \\nregional levels) \\n- Bottom- up co -learning seminars and course modules  involving stakeholders throughout the project’s running \\nperiod but in particular as core components of the LL setup (local & regional levels)  \\nTo further situate stakeholders’ knowledge, the methodology in this project builds on deeply involving stakeholder \\nrepresentatives throughout the project to shape its methodology, via (a) yearly consortium  meetings  for collaborative  \\nproject design & adjustment, participated by selected stakeholder representatives (regional, national & European \\nlevels) and (b) a multi -level, representative advisory board for the project, composed of stakeholder -representing \\nassociations. Local, regional, national , and Europe an-level actors are further included via the Pan-European NC2 Hub \\n(SO6).  \\nAn interdisciplinary methodology grounded in a SSH approach   \\nGiven the need to integrate multiple sources of insight –  biological, ecological, sociological, economic , and \\nagricultural, to name a few – interdisciplinary approaches to knowledge creation and activation are indispensable for \\nCRITTER . Disciplines from SSH, Agricultural Science , Natural Resource Management  and Conservation Sciences \\nform  the core of this project. Agricultural and conservation science are crucial for grounding the project in existing \\nknowl edge, tools , and technologies for optimizing the encounter between agriculture and LCs , existing work having \\naddressed coexistence and sustainable use aspects. SSH  (particularly  the multispecies research approach at the basis \\nof the paradigm shift this project proposes ) offers a substantive contribution in critically interrogating existing \\nassumptions about human relations with other species. S uch an interrogation is conducive to addressing the problem \\nat hand in a way that multiple stakeholders lifeworlds are actively drawn into the enhance ment of coh abitati on.  \\nThe research methods adopted for such  a coll aborative and non- human -centric approach to knowledge creation and \\nimpact aim at generating, analysing , and bringing together various kinds of data, from biological to cultural, \\nhistorical, and statistical ones at all stages of the project methodology. We combine diverse  research methods, from \\nsurveys, statistics and modelling to qualitative relational methods developed for exploring multispe cies relations and \\nmore traditional methods such as interviews.

For instance, to understand the interaction between humans and wolves, the research team might use and \\ncombine GPS data of wolves’ movements, biological data of their species- specific behaviour in that particular area, \\nfarmers’ and other stakeholders ’ situated knowledge and attitudes as well as cultural narratives concerning wolves. \\n \\n31 Swanson, Heather Anne. \"Methods for multispecies anthropology: Thinking with salmon otoliths and scales.\" Social Analysis  61.2 (2017): 81 -99. \\nCall: [ HORIZON -CL6 -2024 -FARM2FORK -01-1] — [Agro -pastoral/outdoor livestock  systems and wildlife management ] \\n Part B - Page 10 of 50 Such data are put in a creat ive dialogue in iterative multidisciplinary analytic sessions to be organized. Using different  \\ntypes and modalities  of data and combining creatively  ways of analysing (e.g. taking a narrative approach to \\nmeasurements) enables gaining a multi- sided and novel understanding of the interactions and entanglements that take \\nplace in the contact zone.  A challenge usually arising with such an approach is the one of adequately accessing more -\\nthan- human agency and knowledge  or co-creating knowledge with animals (an d other species). Most scientific \\nmethods32 hinge on human interpretation and as such are only partial representations of the lived reality of other -\\nthan-humans. The project  addresses this b y deploying multiple methods, including novel nonrepresentational, \\nsensory, and other narrative methods that enable going beyond fully anthropocentric modes of knowing and learning . \\nWe are aware of the partiality and situatedness of the knowledge that we generate with all of our stakeholders (human \\nand other -than- human) and aim to achieve as complete a representation as possible and to identify as well as explicate \\npower dynamics in the research process. C hallenges related to int erdisciplinarity amongst the research team might \\narise,  in relation to using  different conceptual vocabular ies and to working within different ( even  disparate) \\nparadigms in ways that might complicate commensurability  and collective knowledge gen eration . Yet all consortium \\npartners have extensive experience with interdisciplinary work , which  render s them ab le to understand and engage \\nwith other disciplines’ approaches, therefore this challenge is relatively  limited.  Also, t ime will be d edicate d in \\nproject me etings  to acknowledge differences across and within disciplines, value different disciplinary contributions \\nand create trust to  enable partners to approach initial ambiguit ies around terminology in an open-minded way. \\nA three -step methodology  built on iterative multi- stakeholder inclusion  \\nThe project ’s methodology unfolds in three steps that together  offer a more systematic and homogenized approach \\nto generating and leveraging localized knowledge for enhancing cohabit ation  in NCCZ s. The three steps detailed \\nbelow iteratively develop knowledge , methods , and practices which the project progressively aggregates to a broader \\nlevel while remaining tuned to local differences as well as the diversity of stakeholder needs and challenges.  \\n \\nFigure 3 Three -step methodology of CRITTER  \\nSTEP 1 – Enriching and c onsolidating  European- level  NCCZ knowledge  \\nThe goal of this first step is to establish a consolidated and harm onized overview of existing knowledge and good \\npractices which considers the results of previous and ongoing initiatives  and deepens th ese existing insights by \\ncombining them with an in -depth study of stakeholders’ lifeworlds in 10 NCCZs . The resulti ng inventory of best \\npractices and infrastructures (SO1) incorporates multiple stakeholders’ (farmers, hunters, carnivores, livestock, \\nconservationists, general public, policy makers) unique and potentially diverging contextual needs.  \\nPractically, this step combines three m ethodological approaches  in line with the scope stated for  the topic , namely (1) \\nReviewing existing knowledge relative to agriculture -wildlife interactions in the different EU Member States and \\nAssociated Countries, ( 2) Drawing up a methodology for collecting and reporting comparable data at the European \\nlevel , (3) Performing an  in-depth, ethnographic analysis of stakeholders’ lifeworlds, situating best practices in \\nstakeholders’ circumstances, needs and challenges. To  do so, this step brings the foll owing methods together :   \\nContent analyses of existing academic as well as practitioner  literature and project  reports , as well as discourse \\nanalyses  of existing cultural narratives relative to large carnivores (selected fiction and non -fiction literature, news , \\nand social media ). For the latter, c ultural narratives, including fiction litera ture as much as social media debates , \\nprovide a valuable source of insights regarding how multiple stakeholders conceive of multispecies relations , and \\nspecifically relations between humans and l arge carnivores. Much of the recent literature has recognized the \\ntransformative potential of stories in recasting human -animal relations , for instance questioning the protagonist role \\nof the human in powerful cultural stories33, a deepe r engagement with these narratives offering the potential to \\ntransformed relation s between species and nurture new social imaginaries34 for more just futures.  \\n \\n32 Dowling, R., Lloyd, K., & Suchet- Pearson, S.

Phenomenological interviews36 serve  to uncover the lifeworlds of human stakeholders in relation to \\nwildlife encounters in agropastoral settings and will  identif y existing and diverse values and conceptualizations, \\nemotions, and experiences related to nature, wildlife, other -than-human beings that the human stakeholders hold and \\nact upon. This portion reveals existing  ideological as well as practical challenges, barriers , and gaps towards \\ntransitioning to a cohabitation-oriented approach.  \\nRelational, participative methods  implemented in collaboration with natural scientists and social scientists37, \\nstrengthen the project’s sensitivity to the diverse realities, needs and challenges core to multi -stakeholder and \\nespecially multi- species approaches. For these methods, the project refer s to recent studies on human- animal \\nrelations38 to focus on the way Human -OH relations are signified and practiced in NCCZs. T hese methods may \\ninclude mobile videographies39, art-based inquiries40, collaborative memory -work methods41  as well as collaborative \\nstorytelling  with rather than about OH beings42, specifically livestoc k and carnivores. These methods offer the \\nadvantage of providing a more holistic  understanding of the agencies, actions, and interactions of OH species as co -\\nproducers of the NCCZs . This includes carnivores and livestock but also other plant and animal species as well as \\ngeo-physical elements of the landscape such as bodies of water and soil. Challenges related to skills required for \\nsituated and relational epistemology in qualitative inquiry may arise , which met hodological traini ng will alleviate .   \\nHarmonization and improvement of existing  information : Because information is availabl e in both formal and \\ninformal format s, multiple methods will be utilised to deliver the inventory of best practices and policies. Workshops \\nand semi -structured key informant interviews with a standardised interview protocol applied across countries will be \\nthe key to obtain informal and silent knowledge concerning wildlife management practices and policies in Europe. \\nThis will be followed by a survey to the key experts in different EU member states . Further , published studies and \\nofficial documents will be essential to summarise formal evidence on concerning wildlife management practices and \\npolicies in Europe. A systematic review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-\\nAnalyses (PRISMA) method will be used to synthesise documented information. PRISMA allows  authors to improve \\nthe reporting of systematic reviews and meta- analyses and is a preferred approach in reporting rev iew results. A \\ncombin ation of systematic review s, qualitative workshops and interviews will help identify knowl edge and data gaps.   \\nCombined, t hese methods provide the basis for setting up an inventory of relevant practices and policies applied in \\nwildlife and agro -pastoral systems. By further processing the data and appraising different practices and policies, \\nsuccess stories and best practices can be identified. This will also provide data concerning different types of damages, \\npositive and negative externalities an d institutional arrangements related to wildlife damages, damage compensations \\nand resources used to protect eith er lives tock production system or wildlife and allow the classification of damages \\nand compensation systems. Where sufficien t quantitative information is available, standardised cost calculations can \\nbe applied to characterise the magnitude of damages and damage compensations.  For synthesising best practices of \\nlivestock farming and wildlife management, standardised operating protocols (SOP) for data collection will be developed. The SOPs will ensure that data will be collected by using the same metrics, or  in the absence of same \\nmetrics, the SOPs will enable sufficient information to convert the datasets into a harmonised inventory of data.  \\nSTEP 2 – Upgrading  (local- level ) cohabitation in NCCZ s \\nThe goal of the second step is to develop and improve Tools, T echnologies , and Management processes (TTM) \\nfor enh anced cohabitation between  agriculture, wildlife , and wider stakehold er groups in society.  To do so, this \\nstep builds on the Living Lab (LL) method : open innovation ecosystems in rea l-life environments using iterative \\nfeedback processes throughout a lifecycle approach of an innovation to create sustainable impact43.

Each LL is followed throughout their running period by a  multi-\\nstakeholder  team of researchers from the different academic disciplines represented in the consortium , wildlife \\nconservation, and farming sector stakeholders, whose competences combine to identify and assess the human as well \\nas organizational factors shaping the eff ective adoption and implementation of tools, technologies , and management \\nprocesse s (TTM).  The TTM implemented and assessed in this second step vary across the respective LLs, due to \\ndifferences in each LL’s socio -cultural, economic, geographical, and biological characteristics. The complex systems \\nthinking framework , which fosters the integration of biological, economic , and social  scien ce-huma nities  \\ndisciplines, allows this step to adequately consid er the biophysical and socio- economic and policy context s in which \\nthe limitations to livestock  production and to conservation of wild species  occur. The forma tive conc ept of coupled \\nsocial -ecological systems offers an integrative framework in this step, and takes into co nsideration  biophysical \\nprocesses, such as wild species biology and livestock production, and their associated social actors (farmers, \\ntechnicians, social grou ps) and institutions ( policy ma kers, norms, rules).  \\nDecisions  relative to the combination of implemented TTMs adequate for the respective contexts will be taken in \\nconcert with local stakeholders. In each LL, social science approaches with a combination of deliberative research, \\nsurveys and monitoring methods  are used to analyse the motivations and dr ivers behind them to inform strategies \\nfor securing farming continuity and long- term provision of public goods, specifically conservation of wild species.  \\nIn addition to the quantitative and qualitative tools used for monitoring TTM implementation in the LLs, the TTM \\nassessment includes  a participatory cost/benefits analysis (CBA ) of current and new farming strategies that \\npreserve, protect, and  valorise wildlife (e.g., large carnivores and ungulates) and pastoralism  and thus enhance \\ncohabitation, taking into consideration farmers’ rol e and challenges on their livelihoods . Following the LLs across \\nthe project’s running period, the participatory CBA integrates  the novel findings emerging in the LLs relative to TTM  \\nto iteratively  update the direct and indirect, intended, and unintended, short , and long- term, quantifiable and \\nunquantifiable, tangible and intangible, certain and probabilistic, internal and external costs and benefit s of \\npreserving, protecting and valorising wildlife and pastoralism at the level of LLs.  \\nAgropastoral systems co ntribute to provide a variety of ecosystem services, and the damages occasioned by LCs can \\ncause the abandonment of marginal areas and a consequent loss of services. Based on  the LL s, a GIS (geographic \\ninformation system) analysis  will be performed to identify the environmental value of the land managed by the \\nfarms; different scenario s will be produced according to the solution proposed by the LL and by literature review. A \\nconsequential  Life Cycle Analysis  (LCA)  approach will be implemented to explore th e potential effects of the \\ndifferent scenarios in terms of provisioning and non- provisioning ecosystem services.  \\nThis step further involves develop ing and test ing a Digital Twin (DT) modelling prototype  in the LLs , allowing \\nfor combin ing prediction models with real- time data . Widely used in engineering and construction, the adoption of \\nDigital Twin technology in conservation is still in its infancy  but has be en successfully adopted for biodiversity \\nconservation when monitoring animal migration . Improving and extending t his technology into the context of human -\\nwildlife encounters constitutes a promising avenue for ensuring real -time data collection and monitoring. Exploring \\nthe technology’s potential for citizen science data collection , the project ensures local but also potentially cross -\\nborder multi- actor  involvement in ensuring successful agriculture- carnivore cohabitation.  \\nIn order to improve the adoption and implementation of the chosen TTM  in the longer run, step 2 not only develops \\nand improves innovative TTM , but embeds them in participative, dialogical co-learning methods supporting \\nthe paradigm -shift from conflict to cohabitation among local and regional stakeholders. These methods \\nleverage and support the LLs as multi -stakeholder  space s of co- decision, co- design, co- implementation , and \\nparticipatory assessment where farmers ’ group and shepherds have a central role  in dialogue  with other \\nstakeholders . Field experts from governmental an d non- governmental conservation and nature management \\norganizations as well as grass- roots agroecology educators collaborate with the project’s academic partners to \\ndevelop, implement, and improve these co- learning methods.  Challenges to translating the cohabitation paradigm \\nlinguistically and also in terms of implementation  may arise, some stakeholders potentially misunderstanding the \\nconcept of cohabitation as a romantic notion of peaceful , damage -free coexistence. It may also be challenging to \\ntranslate s takeholders’  experiences, knowledges and existing strategies that have been long embedded in a worldview \\nof “ownership” and top- down “management” of land  and livestock, and wildlife a s a factor that comes to conflict \\nwith human needs into an alternative paradigm of cohabitation.  To address this challenge, this project builds on \\nCall: [ HORIZON -CL6 -2024 -FARM2FORK -01-1] — [Agro -pastoral/outdoor livestock  systems and wildlife management ] \\n Part B - Page 13 of 50 participative co- learning methods (communities of practice44) allowing local stakeholders to co-shape the idea and \\npractice of cohabitation  instead of being imposed an academic defini tion clashing with their lived experiences.   \\nIn line with this project’s methodological as well as theoretical ambition of adopting a relational, participatory multi-\\nstakeholder approach that treats research participants in the field as valued participants  in this research project rather \\nthan subjects under study, the LLs’  practical as well as budgetary constitution allocates resources t o different \\nstakeholders contributing to the LL implementation, prominently the farmers on whose farms TTM  will b e \\nimplemented and monitored. As this task requir es continued active engagement by the farmers for activating and \\nmaintaining the se TTM  tools , the LL s also considers monetary and non- monetary compensation for farmers’ time \\nallocation for  successfully leveraging these tools at farm level.  \\nThe following tables detail each living lab’s characteristics :  \\nLIVING LAB 1 - Aragón  \\nMain \\nstakeholders:  \\nFarmers, \\nagricultural \\nadvisory services, nature \\nconservation \\nexperts, scientists  \\nCountry:  \\nSpain  \\nGeographic \\narea : Aragón \\n(Huesca and Zaragoza \\nprovinces, \\nnortheast Spain)  \\nFocus  wildlife : \\nWolf  \\n Agro -pastoral/outdoor livestock farming system: \\nSheep: meat farming systems in mountain and/or \\nsemiarid conditions  \\nConflicts in the management of farming systems and natural resources : Recent sporadic predation \\nby individual wolves in new contact zones  where  \\ncross between  the Iberian wolf population to the \\nwest and the Italian wolf population from the east \\nhave been documented.

This results in overall negative \\nperception of wolf and bear by local rural population (fear and hate is on rise), which is used \\nby local politicians to gain voters. On the other hand national park and state forestry \\ncompanies would like to shift to close -to-nature forest management, but this is hampered by \\nhigh density of wild ungulates (red and roe deer, wild boars) causing damages  on forests, \\nespecially on natural regeneration.

Dairy cattle mostly grazing outdoor in summer, sheep also throughout the \\nyear. Still present the cultural heritage associated with livestock farming.    \\n Conflicts in the  management of farming \\nsystems and natural resources:  \\nLivestock farming systems experienced a strong decline in the last decades, which has \\nresulted into a loss of grassland areas important for Ecosystem services (see below). Recent \\narrival of wolves exerts further pressure on farms and has resulted in predation events, mostly \\non sheep, and the need to protect also young cattle during outdoor periods in high -elevation \\nsummer pastures. Part -time farmers quitting sheep farming, or reducing flocks’ size and \\ngrassland management, due to the conflict.    \\nCurrent wildlife management - mitigation measures - and effectiveness:  \\nElectrified nets and night enclosure have been implemented by some farmers.

In our \\nexpectation, optimal TTM for enhanced cohabitation will be distinct across contexts. Consequently, step 3 does not offer a one- size- fits-all optimal combination of TTM  but aggregates optimal tools and practices for TTM  in a \\nscenario -based way . Step 3  delineates 4-6 scenarios differing based on the following factors which we dr aw from \\nexisting research, and which the project’s empirical work will  supplement with additional relevant factors . Current \\nfactors include type and average sizes of local farming systems, local stakeholders’ individual attitudes towards \\n(cohabitation with) LCs , cultural images and narratives about LCs , human and LC population density, political and \\nlegal frameworks for TTM . Each scenario will represent a unique combination of factors, representative of NCCZ \\nacross Europe. For each scenario, the project det ails the most appropriate TTM  for enhanc ed cohabitation.  \\nIn view of optimizing TTM  on the European level, the project aggregates the scenario -based TTM  \\nrecommendations to the European level  in two ways  supporting the replicability of the LLs optimization practices \\nand methods  across Europe and beyond: (1) w here appropriate, step 3  identifies commonalities in appropriate TTM  \\nacross scenarios which can form the basis of European  level policy and decision- making and (2) step 3  develops and \\ndetails methods and processes which can be implemented across Europe for identifying which scenario a NCCZ in \\nEurope most closely resembles, and on this basis, which combinations of TTM  tools and practices are the most likely \\nfit with the NCCZ in question. This step also assesses the extent to which context -based models’ and CBAs ’ ability \\nor inability to capture differences across stakeholders’ values affects regional, national, and European- level policy \\ndecisions. A possible challenge relative  to the latter assessment lies in i nsufficient or inadequate data emerging from \\nthe LL con texts to allow meaningful, broader -level sensitivity analyses. The project will address such a challenge \\nthrough periodic assessments of data quality and quantity gathered in the LLs, and if necessary, engage in the \\ncollection of additional data beyond the LL contexts.  \\nCombining these elements with steps 1 & 2, step 3 formulates policy- and decision -making recommendations to \\nenhance cohabitation in NCCZs across Europe. In addition to a  best practices inventory for TTM in  NCCZs , the \\nrecommendations detail  processes, protoc ols, and methods for (a) harmonizing  data collection and conflict \\nmonitoring , (b) enhanced co-decision & co -learning processes in NCCZs, (c) local- level environmentally and \\necosystem -inclusive participatory CBA, (d) technical and sociopolitical implementation and use of DT \\ntechnologies for real -time modelling and deci sion- making  (e) local -level scenario -based decision -making .  \\nIn addition to relying on statistical , economic, and modelling methods, this third step leverages participative \\nmethods for collective learning and decision -making  when it comes to formulating policy- and decision-making \\nrecommendations.

The relational research approach and methodologies the project uses \\nconsider the situate dness46 of human actors , emphasizes the role of gender and sexuality – as well as other relevant \\nsociological dimensions, such as race/ethnicity, migration histories, and socio -economic class, (dis)abilities - in \\nexperiencing and shaping relationships, action possibilities, and ways of seeing, perceiving, ‘knowing’, and \\nultimately also shaping the world.    \\nThe project takes into account that the movement of people, particularly young and educated individuals, from rural \\nto urban areas; as well as influx of migrant workers into agricultural areas, can lead to changes in the demographic \\nand socio -economic structure of rural communities. This can have implications for gender roles and relations, as well \\nas for the viab ility of agricultural and pastoral practices. Gender equality is often seen as a cornerstone of rural \\ndevelopment, with the empowerment of rural women being a key tool to protect and rejuvenate rural communities. \\nWomen living in rural areas have frequently been depicted – and therefore also responsibilized - as the primary \\ndrivers of rural sustainability. In 2000, promoting gender equality became an official goal of the Rural Development \\nProgramme (RDP), regulated through gender mainstreaming , and evaluated in the formal Common Agriculture \\nPolicy (CAP) evaluation rounds.

However, research also indicates that while progressive policies  and changing societal \\ndynamics have led t o some changes in women’s participation in the agropastoral work environments, gendered spatial \\nsegregations and division of labour remain  common in farming47 in ways that reflect the deep embeddedness of \\ngendered myths and stereot ypes related to agriculture as well as wildlife conflict. Many gender -oriented  agropastoral \\npolicies and initiatives, while intending to promote women’s  participation, take approaches to gender that exclude \\nthe experiences, challenges as well as situated expertise of individua ls whose gender identities and sexualities fall \\noutside the heteronormative social order48. Identifying and addressing barriers to cohabitation in agropastoral settings \\nwill benefit from better understanding the situated experiences of stakeholders in a way that represents the spectrum \\nof gender and sexuality that are observed and intersect with other sociological dimensions in societies today49.  \\nOur approach therefore takes into consideration the gendered dimensions of knowledge, experience, and expertise in  \\nagropastoral life as well as with wildlife encounters; in identifying problems as well as developing and coordinating \\nsolutions towards cohabitation amongst ( and within) species.  We further contribute to the state-of- the-art in the \\nresearch landscape by atten ding to an inclusive spectrum of gendered experiences in the agropastoral field.    \\nOpen Science practices & Data management  \\nCRITTER will execute open science practices considering the EC strategic priority of Open Science and guided by \\nthe EU FAIR (Finda ble, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) Data Management guidelines.

The best practice inventory is based on a harmonized  database containing wildlife \\nmanagement approaches, number, and most common types of damages by region and carnivore  (KER3).  The best \\npractices inventory serves as  the basis for the development and improvement of innovative and sustain able practices \\nand tools in 10 living labs  across Europe. The co-innovation approach use d in CRITTER is critical for the \\nsustainability of innovative practices, as it explicitly addresses aspects of social sustainability . The LLs gather  \\ninformation  directly benefiting  local - and regional -level stakeholders (TG1 -9) in key and diverse NCCZs  in Europe . \\nEach LL implements, monitors, and ass esses practices and tools to prevent and control negative consequences of \\nencounters between livestock and wild animals with the goal of improving the adoption and implementation  of the \\nbest practices invent oried in KER 1 (SO2) . Beyond assessing and improving the practices and tools’ technological,  \\neconomic, and political implementation  (SO2), the project supports their adoption and implementation through co-\\nlearning methods targeting the key local stakeholders (TG1 -4) with respect to the environmental, economic but also \\nsocio -cultural challenges as well as opportunities of NCCZs . Co-learn ing takes place via 5 NC2 modules (KER4) \\nwhich will be developed in collaboration with relevant  local  educational institutions (TG8) and with involvement \\nof key stakeholder representative s (TG5, 6, 7) . The modules are pilot -tested in the LLs and thereafter made \\naccessible to stakeholder -representing associations (TG5 -7) for wider adoption and integrated in  the Pan -European \\nNC2 Hub (KER 8) for wider dissemination  together with the best practice s inventory (KER 1) (SO7) .  \\nEO2:  Recommendations/policy advice on optimal management at EU level of wildlife and ag ropastoral systems  \\nThe NCCZs  studied in  this project are representative of the large diversity of livestock -carnivore NCCZs  existing \\nacross Europe on the environmental (biodiversity, large carnivore population size & density, geographical landscape \\ncharacteristics), economic (income levels, size and vitality of agricultural sector, existence of complementary \\nsources of income)  and socio- cultural level (human population density; emotions, imaginaries and narratives \\nrelative to large carn ivores).

T he Hub builds on three pillars: (1) information –\\nstakeholders can access the project’s NC2 modules (KER4)  and the B est Practices inventory  (KER3); (2) \\ncommunication – stakeholders can contact other relevant stakeholders at all levels, in country/region- specific \\ndiscussi on forums held in national languages as well as  in EU -level discussion forums held in English; (3) \\ncoordination – stakeholders can coordinate the implementation of improved practices and tools for the management \\nof contact zones between li vestock and large carnivores with local as well a s relevant national/regional/EU \\nstakeholders. Coordination across Europe relative to data collection and reporting is improved through the \\nharmonized data collection and reporting method (KER 2) developed in WP 1 (SO1) , streng thened by the \\nimplementation of the policy recommendations ( KER 7) formulated in WP4  (SO5) . \\nCRITTER  will contribute to the “ Sustainable, climate neutral and biodiversity friendly farming systems” aspect of \\nthe topic’s destination “Fair, healthy and environment -friendly food systems from primary production to \\nconsumption ”. In part icular, the project results will contribute in the long term  to the following expecting impacts  \\n(EIs). \\nCONTRIBUTION TO EXPECTED IMPACTS (EIS) - ENABLE SUSTAINABLE FARMING SYSTEMS THAT : \\nEI1: provide consumers with affordable, safe, healthy , and sustainable food  \\nSmall-scale farming and herding organizations are crucial for the maintenance  of traditional ways of producing food \\n(e.g., cheese, meat, cereals) more in line with nature and seasonality (e.g., cheese produced using local milk and \\nnatural bacteria cultures).  The risk of losing animals because of predators is a cost that impairs economic \\ncompetitiveness of farming in regio ns where LC are present. Th is project will be conducive t o farms beco ming \\nmore resilient especially towards risks caused by LC, but also ungulates. CRITTER ’s particular focus on developing \\nand improving TTM  that are economically and practically feasible to implement by sm all-scale farmers  (TG1)  \\ncontribut es to the economic sustainability of traditional grassland -based farms, ultimately benefiting consumers . \\nThe project will strengthen the capacity of organic, traditional and agropastoral farming systems to produce meat \\nand dairy products in a sustainable manner especially in ru ral, mountainous, and other less favourable areas. Most \\ndirectly, this project  details feasible solutions to reduce damages in livestock -wildlife  encounters (SO2&3), thereby  \\nreducing economic and motivational  pressures favouring livestock farming abandonment  and increasing local food \\nprovisioning security for consumers . Reduced risk of wildlife damages also improve s economic viability of farming \\nand reduce costs for farmers to supply their products at a more competitive price, such as artisanal products, henc e \\nmaking them mo re affordable to consumers as well. Finally, t he project’s promotion of  a cohabitation -focused \\napproach to farmers’ relationship with large carnivores ( KER4) can facilitate farmers’ promotion of their products \\nin terms of extrinsic quality attributes (quality characteristics dependent on the production systems, not the product) , \\nwhich  respond s to consumers’  sustainability  concerns in terms of biodiversity  and animal welfare.  \\nEI2: increase the provision of ecosystem services  \\nCRITTER’s specific focus on enhan cing cohabitation between multiple stakeholders in NCCZs contributes to the \\nprovision of ecosystem services in several respects.  Feasible solutions to reduce damages in the encounter between \\nlivestock and wildlife (SO2) and enhance cohabitation between agriculture and LCs can contribute to the \\nconservation of high nature -value farmlands by maintain ing grassland in marginal geographical areas, with positive \\neffects in terms of cultural, regulating, and supporting ecosystem s ervices. Cultural ecosystem services then a rise \\nin terms of better mental and physical health  among others  for local population (reduced fear , higher well -being in \\nnature)  and tourists  (TG 12) but crucially also farmers (TG1)  who face risk of damages to livelihood and even  \\nfamily , caused by predators and ungulates.  Better TTM  reduces farmers stress relative to workload and  livelihood \\nCall: [ HORIZON -CL6 -2024 -FARM2FORK -01-1] — [Agro -pastoral/outdoor livestock  systems and wildlife management ] \\n Part B - Page 24 of 50 preservation  and equally important the quality of life of the family, and the psychological health or status of the \\nfarmers and fa mily members , reducing mental load  (e.g. nights without sleep, care for their animals, etc. ). The NC2 \\nmodules ( KER 4) facilitating cohabitation using art-based and stor y-telling techniques provide cultural ecosystem \\nservices for farmers  and local population (TG 1 & 12) in terms of their aesthetic and spiritual benefits, which allow \\nfor a reim agination of human relationships with large carnivores . Attractive and safe touristic landscapes where \\nlocal stakeholders are protectors of and advocates for local biodiv ersity ( also induced by KER4) offer cu ltural \\necosystem services in terms of recreation  and tourism for locals and tourists ( TG12). The project contributes to \\nregulating ecosystem services by developing and improving TTM  that lower large carnivores’ access to livestock \\nanimals, inducing them to feed increasingly on other wildlife and hence benefiting control of population dynamics \\namong wild boards, deer and rabbits that cause large losses in crops (beneficial also to agriculture farmers) or control \\nof zoonosis and other animal diseases such as African swine fever with important economic consequen ces \\n(beneficial to society at large and farmers). Supporting ecosystem services.  Perennial grasslands have been found  \\nto be an efficient way of sequestering carbon when compared to cereals cultivated one year only. Addition ally, as  \\ngrasslands are typically covered by vegetation throughout the year, agro-pastoral systems are an efficient means of \\nmitigation erosion and flooding on agricultural land. Inclusion of grasslands in crop rotation can also he lp in \\ncombatting pests and crop diseases, when compared to monocultures of cereals.  \\nEI3: restore and strengthen biodiversity  \\nApex predators  like the bear and wolf  have profound effects on ecosystems, as they control  the populations of \\nsmaller predators, herbivores, and plants, and are  capable of self -regulation. They are central to the functioning of \\necosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity  (TG11). T he project’s aim s of reducing \\nillegal killing  and prevent ing attacks on domestic animals through optimized  TTM  (SO2) can thereby contribute to \\nhigher success rates i n the restoration and strengthening of biodiversity.  Furthermore, the project promotes the \\nconservation of livestock genetic resources , as local breeds/populations are maintained by small -scale farming \\nsystems, which the project and its results benefit (TG1).  Additionally , agro -pastoral systems (especially with \\nperennial grasslands) have multiple benefits in terms of promoting biodiversity in farmed areas when compared to \\ncereal -based farming, especially monoc ultures of cereals. As the project creat es enabl ing conditions for pasture -\\nbased live stock farming, it will lead to increased biodiversity in farming areas.  \\nEI4: foster plant, animal , and public health  \\nLarge carnivores have a beneficial impact on landscapes and ecosystems , among others in respect to grazing and \\nfertilization patterns  of large grazers (wider distribution of grazing spaces  with advantages among others for plant \\nhealth) . Especially ungulates can transmit zoonotic pathogens either through human- wildlife contacts or \\ncontaminations occurring via non- timber forestry products such as berries or mushrooms, as well as transmission \\nof zoonoses via far med animals to food and humans (TG 11 & 12). Improved  control of wildlife populations will \\nthus mitigate the risks of zoonotic diseases for humans as well . \\nEI5: improve animal welfare  \\nBetter prevention of contact between livestock and large carnivores (SO2) leads to improve livestock (TG 10) \\nwelfare . Depredation , a fatal event for involved livestock, also significantly affect the welfare of the surviving \\nanimals  as it induces stress and fear among livestock . As such, p reventing depredation  improv es livestock welfare \\nin two areas (Freedom from pain, injury, or disease; Freedom from fear and distress) of the five defined by  the \\nEuropean Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Far ming . Abortions, loss of lactation, fear, agony, and \\nstress are common in sheep and goat herds after the attack of the large carnivores,  which are detrimental in terms \\nof animal welfare and ultimately result in (typically not compensated) e conomic damage to farmers.  Reduced illegal \\nkilling  of large carnivores not only prevent s the loss of individuals but counteracts the negative effects of \\nuncontrolled removal of wolves . Contrary  to authorized culling, uncontrolled (illegal) killing of wolves often \\ndemolishe s the social structure of the wolf packs and can lead to problematic wolf behaviour when dispersed \\nmembers of the pack are no longer capable of organised hunt of the wil d prey and might start preying on the less \\ndemanding, often under -protected livestock.  \\nEI6: generate fair economic returns for farmers  \\nDamages and associated expenses or lack of income represent an overmeasurate burden especially for small -scale \\nfarming systems  (TG1) . This relates not only to direct costs, but also loss of income, excessive use of time resources \\non prevention and changes in livestock/grazing management. Better mitigation of LC damages among livestock \\nreduces the risk of farmers losing the ir valuable animals and even more valuable breeding stock, which may have \\nbeen accumul ated over several years of breeding effort. It also  helps to mitigate damage caused to farms \\ninfrastructures such as fences or light -structure d animal shelters. As these losses are not only related to the loss of \\nvalue of animals and property but also to the loss of income -generating potential, the project will support economic \\nviability and income generation among farmers.  By offering feasible solutions to reduce damages resulting from \\nCall: [ HORIZON -CL6 -2024 -FARM2FORK -01-1] — [Agro -pastoral/outdoor livestock  systems and wildlife management ] \\n Part B - Page 25 of 50 the encounter of livestock and wildlife (SO2&3 ) as explained above, this project reduces  economic and motivational \\npressur es favouring livestock farming abandonment. Furthermore, a cohabitation  focus ed approac h to the encounter \\nbetween agriculture and large carnivores , facilitated by the project’s NC2 modules (KER4), opens new business \\nopportunities for touris tic services or the production and marketing of products  (e.g. meat  or cheese ), wh ich \\ncontributes to species conservation. Finally, the project’s participatory  cost-benefit analysis (SO3) assessing current \\nand new farming strategies that preserv e, protect , and valorise wildlife and pastoralism p rovide ind ications for fairer \\ncompensation and incentive measures in agricultural policies  (KER7 , SO5) .  \\nOther impacts  \\nNATURE CULTURE ’S CONTRIBUTION  \\nSCIENTIFIC  IMPACT  \\nCRITTER contributes to existing scientific knowledge within specific disciplines but also on an interdisciplinary \\nlevel. The scientific community will benefit from the project generating new datasets and kn owledge about the \\nefficacy of TTM enhancing cohabitation between wildlife and agropast oral farming (SO1). Harmonising data \\ncollection approaches (KER2) and datasets (KER3) will enable  the scientific community to better compare the \\nresults across countries and studies. Reviews conducted by WP1 will provide state of the art knowledge to scientists \\nenabling future research projects (KER1, KER3) . Not only developing and improving TTM  in the LLs but \\nembedding them in participatory co- learning processes (SO2) advances existing research in the AAR discipline  \\nboth in terms of TTM  methodology and in terms of opening up for a new epistemological approach to the field. The \\noverarching SSH-based theoretical framework guiding intradisciplinary development throughout the project adds \\nnew linkages between especially natur al scientific and social scientific academic disciplines wh ich for the most part \\nstill tend  to evolve in parallel instead of together. By providing a ‘context of contexts’50, the SSH -based contribution \\nto co mbining disciplines coincide s with a practical and practicable combination of methodol ogies in rural \\ncommunities and NCCZ.  The synthesis and comparison of modelling frameworks for TTM  scenarios offers a \\ncrucial  overview of existing field -level approaches  allowing an aggregation building on - and applicability relevant \\nfor – various local  and regional specific conditions (KER6 ). The broadened applicability of the Digital Twin \\ntechnology not only in conservation but at the point of encounter between agricult ure and LCs  contributes to the \\nscientific developing of this technology along with fur ther heightening its societal impact.  The combination of a \\nfield-level participatory CBA with a n aggregating sensitivity analysis brings together two complementary \\nmethodological approaches in an innovative way, bridging bottom -up participatory  methods and large -scale \\nresource economic analyses.  \\nEDUCATIONAL  IMPACT  \\nThe project will develop and implement education al NC2 modules  to provide  local  educational resources in affected \\nareas. In addition, t he results of the project, especially knowledge about the perspectives of farmers and the \\nexperience of the living lab will be relevant  study modules in existing agricultural high -school programmes, \\ndefining the basis for the understanding of values, perspectives, and narratives of the future stakeholders. The \\nproject’s theoretical framework integrating the field of Multispecies Relations Studies with agricultural and natural \\nresource management f ields constitutes an ideal opportunity for the d evelopment of multispecies management and \\nconservation study modules for incorporation in existing agricultural or conservation study programmes – with the \\nprospects of developing an interdisciplinary, international study programme on multispecies management and \\nconservation c omporting theoretical modules  drawing from the disciplines represented in this pro ject as well as \\npractical modules of study and work in the field, among farmers and/or conservationists. Students educated via such \\na programme would constitute ideal candidates for working in stakeholder- representation associations (TG 5, 6, 7 \\n& 9) \\nSOCIO -ECONOMIC  IMPACT  \\nBeyond EI detailed above (specifically EI1 & 6), t his project’s socio -economic impact lies in its key combination  \\nof social and economic benefits, which contri bute to (human)  population maintenance in rural regions by reducing \\nhuman- human conflict  while increa sing opportunities for emotionally and financially rewarding  livelihoods in \\nNCCZs. By contributing to ensuring a stronger economic base for populations in the rural areas affected (EO1, EI5, \\nEI6) working against a de-population of European rural areas , agro-pastoral communities will benefit in terms of \\neconomically and socially stronger, more connected and prosperous livelihoods creating resilient communities  – in \\nline with the long-term vision for the EU’s rural areas up to 2040 .

SDG5  – achievement \\nof gender equality in particular in farming and agricultu re; beyond empowering women in rural communities  (multi -\\nactor approach  in living labs ), also recognizing diversity in gender and sexuality, and working towards  full and \\neffective participation  of individuals of diverse gender and sexual identities in the decision -making process , \\nrecognising the ir work value and expertise in the management of natural resource s. SDG8  – better work conditions \\nand economic growth for local stakeholders  by providing policy recommendations that support small farmers in \\nrural and mountain communities across Europe and their sustainable tourism, promoting local culture and  products . \\nSDG12 - sustainable food production & consumption by supporting rural and mountain communities  usually at risk \\nof depopulation, thus preserving their traditional practices in local food production . SDG13  – contribution to climate \\naction  by aiming to  an enhanced  cohabitation in rural and mountain area s and a human -wildlife balance , thus leading \\nto further steps in the restoration of biodiversity . SDG 15  – improved life on land by optimising the handling of \\nconflicts between humans ( farmin g systems) and wildlife ( large carnivore s) in a holistic way, therefore contributing \\nto a more  sustainable management of terrestrial ecosystems  and to halting land degradation and biodiversity loss . \\nEUROPEAN STRATEGIES  \\nCRITTER contributes to several European long -term strategies . Firstly, it contributes to the long-term vision for \\nthe EU’s rural areas up to 2040  in its crucial role of contributing to heritage preservation and community \\nacceptance of biodiversity  as well as creating strong, connected, resilient and prosperous regions. The cohabitation-\\nfocused approach allows communities to engage in constructive dialogue and decision-making to enhance human \\nand other -than-human well -being and development. Secondly, CRITTER ’s focus on cohabitation can serve as \\ninspiration for other topics in the Farm to Fork strategy  and its Biodiversity strategy for 2030, beyond EI1- 6 as \\ndetailed above, as this project offers hands- on solutions for jointly addressing economic, socio -cultural , and  \\nenvironmental priorities in the EU.  The methods and processes summarized in the project’s policy recommendations \\n(KER6) can frui tfully be tested and implemented even in NCCZs across Europe where Nature and Culture intersect \\nbut where large carnivores are not the main conservation issue, as they offer a pathway for b roader cohabitation \\nbetween human and other -than-human beings . \\nSCALE AND SIGNIFICANCE  \\nScale TG1-TG5-TG10  – Continuous involvement of both actors and associations will be ensured in the short and \\nlong term.  During the development and implementation of the LLs, hundreds of farmers, herders and small \\nlandowners belonging to 10 different NCCZs  will actively participate in the LL activities . The project also \\ncollaborates with  minimum 2 farming associations  and 1 herders’ association (AECRANI  and FPA Trento51 through \\ndirect link with  UNIPD and reindeers herding association through direct  link with UoL ) and 4 N GOs (CAMP, DOGA  \\nand WWF -BG and - SK) that have been actively working with local communities  in the  10 LLs. In the long term, t his \\nwill allow us to reach out to thousands of farmers, herders, and small landowners . \\nScale TG 2-TG6 – Partners WWF -BG and WWF -SK will reach  out to local non-governmental conservation actors \\nsuch as the Carpathian Convention, not just in Eastern Europe, but also in other European regions with a speci al \\nfocus on large carnivores’  conservation through direct links to national WWF offices.  At the same time, WWF \\npartners and advisory board members (CIC, IUCN, FACE) will facilitate connections with governmental (Large \\nCarnivore I nitiative  for Europe  within the  International Union for Conservation  of Nature ) and non-governmental \\nconservation actors with expertise in large carnivores.  \\nScale TG3 – We will target n ational and regional offices and agencies in at least 10 countries (e.g., Province of Trento \\nin Italy, Office of the Banskobystrický region of Slovakia, State Nature Conservancy of Slovakia, Administration of \\nthe National Park Muránska Planina, Forests of Slovak Republic state enterprise , Institute of Nature Conservation, \\nPolish Academy of Sciences52, Service public de Wallonie, Département de l\\'Etude  du Milieu naturel et agricole, \\nDirection de la Nature et de l\\'Eau - Cellule faune53). \\n \\n51 https://www.fpatrento.it/  \\n52 Through External Ad visory Board Member Nuria Selva.  \\n53 Through External Advisory Board Member  Alain Licoppe  \\nCall: [ HORIZON -CL6 -2024 -FARM2FORK -01-1] — [Agro -pastoral/outdoor livestock  systems and wildlife management ] \\n Part B - Page 27 of 50 Scale TG 4-TG7 – Being aware of the key role of local hunters in monitoring and culling animal populations, \\nCRITTER will share project results with  such actors  in the different sites part  of the 10 LLs by involving the CIC \\nInternational Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation and FACE - European Federation for Hunting and \\nConservation FACE54. In the long term, CRITT ER’s results will directly impact at least hundred s of thous ands of \\nEuropean hunters through communication activities facilitated by FACE and CIC. \\nScale TG8 –CRITTER will impact edu cation in both formal  - through the academic partners (SDU, UoL, UNIPD, \\nCITA and WUR ) - and informal settings - through SFS and CAMP ’s extensive exp erience in projects with \\neducational purposes . Being member of the BILIM Agroecology Alliance in Europe and Central Asia, CAMP has \\nthe capacity to ensure exchange and transfer peasant farming knowledge by addressing more than 20 organisations \\nfrom 18 countries. Traveling to the LLs, CAMP will apply its expertise also to the invo lved local communities.   \\nScale TG 9 – >10 National and regional authorities in the 7 countries of the LLs will be able to leverage the results \\ntried and tested in  their site-specific conditions including legislative, bio-diverse , and socio -economic parameters , \\njust as policy makers on  a European scale as well as interest organizations can make use of results.  \\nScale TG10 – CRITTER will positively impact millions  of animals  living and migrating across European borders , \\nincluding European large carnivores (wolves , bears, lynxes, wolverines, golden jackals) , livestock animals ( mainly \\novine, caprine, bovines, reindeers) and broa der biodiversity (e.g., birds  and ungulates ) in the 1 0 LLs . \\nScale TG 11 – CRITTER’s focused communication strategy will ensure that the project’s results spread out to citizens \\nand leisure/nature consumers , who will be  positively affected by the envisioned transition towards cohabitation- based \\ncommunities and environment. Such tr ansitio n will reach , in the short term, all the communities living around the 1 0 \\nLLs (corresponding to about 200.000 people), and, in the long term, to far more rural and mountain co mmunities  and \\npotentially millions  of citizens enjoying and “con suming” nature across Europe and working in the tourism  \\nindustry55.   \\nScale TG 12 – Local , regional, national, and European media  in at least 11 European countries  by the end of the \\nproject, spreading out all over Europe after the end of the project e.g. through outlets such as The Conversation.  \\nScale TG 13  - In the short term, the project will target >1000 researchers in the fields of  Agriculture and Animal \\nSciences, Natural Resources and Enviro nmental Management, Social -Ecological Systems Modelling, Multisp ecies \\nRelations Studies & Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics through results publication in peer -reviewed \\njournals and presentation in international conferences and fairs (see section 2.2, dissemination). In the medium-long \\nterm the project will reach >2000 researchers through at least 20 scientists (Phd, postdocs, professors) publishing in \\nconference proceedings and peer -reviewed international journals leading to m inimum 10 publicatio ns in different \\nfields per year thus resulting in at least 40 articles overall. As impact factors of publications increase in time, we are \\npositive to reach the envisioned researchers and the scientific community in the long run. \\nEconomic, social , and environmental significance  \\nCRITTER aligns with European initiatives aimed at improving socio -economic and environmental sustainability. \\nTwo key strategies— the farm -to-fork and the  EU biodiversity 2030—highlight Europe’s aspirations to enhance local \\nfood resilience, promote animal and human welfare, and protect biodiversity. But achieving these ambitious goals \\npresents challenges, notably  in rural areas where conflicts between local communities and large carnivores persist.  \\nCRITTER will contribute to  s trengthen rural resilience  and thus support Europe in bolster ing its rural communities, \\nwhich play a si gnificant role in the bioeconomy in the EU. The bioeconomy in the EU has annual turnover of €2.2 \\ntrillion euro and employs around 17.5 million people. The whole agr i-food chain represents 75% of the employment \\nin the EU’s bioeconomy and accounts for two- thirds of its turnover,56 and although the agri -food chain represents a \\nlot more than just the economy of rural communities, rural areas are home of approximately 30% of the European \\npopulation.57  Additionally, rural areas account for 43.8% of beds in tourism accommodation across the EU and \\nwitness 37% of all nights spent by tourists, highlighting their attractiveness as destinations.58 Rural tourism \\ncontributes to the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of rural areas, and safeguards small -scale \\nfarming, addresses social inequalities, and creates employment opportunities, especially for women, as recognised \\nby the European Parliament,59 which also stresses the point, that Europe’s rich rural heritage generates revenue \\nthrough ecotourism, guided tours, and recreational activities.

Additionally reducing such conflict s will have secondary benefits to both the bioeconomy and \\ntourism sector within the EU . These sectors, as explained above , are massive sectors of strategic and primary \\nimportance to the EU  and sectors where rural communities play a pivotal role.  Since the size of these sectors are so \\nlarge, one easily  can project a benefit of billi on+ euros,  even from a benefit of 1‰  due to peace of mind, reduced \\nconflict , increased quality of life  and increased social coherence in rural areas . Therefore, we highlight how \\nCRITTER  will positively affect these  two huge sectors of strategic importance to the EU.  Finally, a successful \\nimplementation of CRITTER can lead to more efficient human -wildlife management systems outside of Europe , \\nwhich can relieve pressure on the global agricul tural production, alleviate food insecurity and increase productivity  \\namong farmers.60 \\nBARRIERS   \\nCRITTER  has identified and addresses the following barriers that can challenge to what degree the expected \\noutcomes and impacts will be successfully achieved.  \\nBARRIER  CRITTER  MITIGATION STRATEGY  \\nLocal political resistance . Local administrators in \\nrural and mountain areas ma y show reluctance  \\ntowards  European- level implementation of \\ncommon methods & processes . CRITTER ’s co-learning tools and methods are designed t o be \\nadapted to help governmental actors muster political support \\nfrom local constituencies . Furthermore,  government al actors in \\nthe living lab regions  will actively participate in the \\nincorporation o f policy advice , allowing them to get involved \\nin cross -border decision -making . \\nInadequate involvement of local stakeholder  so \\nthat they are reluctant to adopt proposed best \\npractices.  A similar barrier  can arise from  \\ntraditional approaches towards and perceptions of \\nlarge carnivores and wildlife in general in  different \\ngeographical areas, between rural -urban contexts \\nand betwe en categories of stakeholders , which  can \\nlead to misinterpretations and reluctancy in \\naccepting the proposed tools. CRITTER ’s LLs and multi -actor approach has close \\ninteraction with stakeholders at its core and  designed to build \\ntrust and mutual understanding between stakeholders , seeding  \\nfertile ground for adopting the best practices. By safeguarding  \\nparticipation of local actors and hearing and valuing the voice \\nof each participant in the LLs regions , CRITTER  will ensure \\nthe development of tools and polic y advice adapted to the \\ninterests and needs of all the main stakeholders . This will  \\nfurther stimulate the adoption of project’s solutions by \\nstakeholders beyond the LLs in a long- term strategy of \\nenhanced cohabit ation across European NCCZs. \\nFarmer resistance . Farmers are reluctant to accept \\nthe predators\\' presence and be involved in conflict \\nmitigation projects as actors and not simply as \\nbeneficiaries.  The participation of farmers and th eir organisations will be \\nfostered by the participative and bottom -up methods which \\nCRITTER makes accessible via the NC2 Hub, with the support \\nof agricultural and animal science expert of CRITTER . \\nLogistical, technological , and competence -\\nrelated barriers may hinder wide -ranging \\nadoption of the proposed technologies , including  \\nneed for mobile coverage , cameras that might not \\nbe suitable for in the local terrain , lack of people in \\nthe local area competences to install  / operate  / \\nmonitor the recommended TTM . CRITTER ’s continuous collaborative work with diverse \\nstakeholders ensure s the identification of specific challenging \\ncases and, thus, finding  appropriate solutions to be put in \\npractice in the short and medium -long term. Such solutions will \\nbe incorporated in the NatureCulture  Collaborative NC2 Hub, \\nas part of the informative pillar, for future usability in similar \\ncases across other regions.  \\nLanguage & culture/mentality of actors across \\nEuropean contact zones . The linguistic barrier \\ncan be perceived at t wo different levels: 1. \\nDomestically , where local people use a different \\nlanguage and/or domain- specific vocabulary than \\nthe one spoken by external actors ( researchers, \\nconservationists ). 2. Intercountry , when a clear \\ncommunication in a common language like English \\n(not spoken everywhere in Europe) is essential for Where different lan guages are concerned, we will leverage on \\nthe presence of bilingual individuals (this could be the case of \\nLLs in Finland and Spain), multilingual documentation (e.g., \\npresentations, reports , and platform contents), and digital \\ntranslating tools. In relation to domain- specific vocabularies, a \\nsharable list of key concepts will help understanding technical \\nterms and expressions across different fields beyond the project \\nperiod. \\n \\n60 https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what- is-human -wildlife -conflict -and-why-is-it-more -than-just-a-conservation- concern   \\nCall: [ HORIZON -CL6 -2024 -FARM2FORK -01-1] — [Agro -pastoral/outdoor livestock  systems and wildlife management ] \\n Part B - Page 29 of 50 further implementation of the project’s successful \\npractices.  \\nLegal and regulatory . Different regions across \\nEurope may have different legal and regulatory \\nframeworks with respect to certain practices and \\ntools/technologies, land use or biodiversity  \\nconservation.  CRITTER  will engage directly with local authorities to \\nunderstand the local legal and regulatory framework s. Thus, \\nproject’s tools will comply with local laws and regulations to \\nensure success in each LL region. \\nEconomic barriers . The measures may require \\nfinancial resources which are not readily available . The project will deliver a participatory cost-benefit analysis of \\nthe most important measures and provide policy \\nrecommendations. This will provide arguments for securing \\npublic resources where needed, and guide farmers to take \\nactions that are economically viable.  \\n  \\n2.2 Measures to maximise impact - Dissemination, exploitation , and communication #@COM -DIS-VIS-CDV@#  \\nDissemination, exploitation, and communication of results are of outmost importance for  the successful achievement \\nof the project’s results. The Plan for the dissemination and exploitation, including communication activities  will be \\nprovided as a project deli verable (D10.1) in M5. The plan will be aligned and refined in  M19 and M 37, accordingly \\nwith the pro gress of the project. Its main goal is to attract the wider audience and to empower a large number of \\nstakeholders and end- users to uptake the project’s solutions ( see KERs table in  section 2.1)  and thus, to con tribute to \\nenhancing the co -habitation of humans and wildlife . \\n2.2.1 Dissemination and communi cation   \\nThe project’s dissemination and communication strategy is  built in compliance with the Responsible Research and \\nInnovation (RRI) concept and Open Science policy. The strategy includes several target groups and stakeholders . \\nFor more detail, the target g roups’ table in section 2.1  analyses their level of involvement and whether they will \\ndirectly or indirectly benefit from the project’s results. Moreover, CRITTER ’s multi- actor approach makes the main  \\nstakeholders (listed below ) actively engaged in the living  labs’ activities , thus part of the diss emination and \\ncommunication initiatives : \\n• Farmers, shepherds, reindeer herders,  farmers/breeders’ associations, cooperatives \\n• National and local agricultural advisory services, agricultural chamber, farming advisory  services \\n• Nature and wildlife experts  and l ocal wildlife and protected areas management services  \\n• Local (municipal, provinc ial, region al) administrators and governments \\n• National parks and national park administrations \\n• Hunters and game management administrator  \\n• Tourists and tourist services providers \\n• Scientists  \\nThe table below shows the main dissemination  instruments that will be used during the project.  \\nDissemination c hannels and tool s \\nOnline channels  \\nMainly used for communication, the dedicated website will also provide stakeholders with specific information \\nsuch as access to public deliverables and summary of non -confidential information from the private deliverables, \\nand a link to the relevant publications, information about project conferences or events and giv e any stakeholder the \\npossibility to contact the consortium for scientific collaboration.  Moreover, CRITTER’s NatureCulture  \\nCollaboration (NC2) Hub  will serve  as a Community of Practice environ ment  for communication, information and \\ncollaboration. The community will also provide benefits such as improved communication, visible knowledge, and \\nfaster learning. Specific environments will be created for End -users, Policy Makers , and Researchers.   \\nWhen -The project website will be ready by M3 and be maintained at least 2 years after the end of the project.

The expected \\nresults of the project do not strictly include commercial products and/or technologies. However, tangible outputs \\n(tools and practices) are foreseen, as shown in the key exploita ble results (KERs) table in section 2.1. KERs1 -8 will \\ndirect ly benefit  CRITTER’s partners  and stakeholders engaged in the LLs . Open access to some of these tangible \\noutputs in the NC2 Hub will enable actors  in the  wider  agro-pastoral sector across Europe to exploit the project’s \\nresults in their territory  and agricultural practices, enabling socio -economic and cultural return in local communities \\nand society in general. The exploitation plan will consist of the following actions:  \\nCreate synergies and encourage up -take of the solutions by presenting project outputs at events, meetings and \\nconferences - Build a network of stakeholders , CRITTER  raises awareness of the project and promotes  the NC2 \\nHub as key to ensure the  sustainability  and application of proje ct learnings  even beyond the funding period. This will \\nencourage stakeholders to join the network, prom ote it  further with their own networks, and build on these, creat e a \\nripple effect - Sustainability of the partnership:  To ensure the sustainability of the consortium partnership internally \\nand with its stakeholders, CRITT ER will define a governance model and action plan not only to advance the project\\'s \\noutputs but to create an environment that will help foster new forms of open research and innovation partnerships and value chains across sectors, disciplines & geographical regions  - Implementation of the R&I Agenda : Targeted \\nnetworking with research funding agencies and EC bodies will ensure the that the CRITTER R&I Agenda – or parts \\nof it – will be taken up and implemented by these bodies.  \\nIn the long- term, this exploitation p lan will be conduci ve to locals  being more prone to stay  in rural areas  that have \\nthe possibility to develop tourism sustainably with positive repercussions in the local economy  and environment. The \\nincreased communication and coordination among stakeholders at lo cal, national, and European level facilitate d by \\nthe NC\\n2 Hub will gen erate ease of access to information and possibly  less bureaucracy for farmers, administrators , \\nand conservationists , saving money in the long -term. \\nStrategy for the management of intellectual property  \\nQuestions of ownership, protection of pre -existing know -how and project results and access rights to and exploitation \\nof pre -existing know -how and results will be defined through the Consortium Agreement. Intellectual property rights \\n(IPRs) will be effectively defined and managed in the Consortium Agreement (CA) (GA). To implement project \\nactivities, CRITTER ’s partners agree to allow free use of such knowledge to other project partners.  Except for the \\nNC2 Hub protected via copyright , all project’s results (KERs1 -7) are expected  to be openly available to external \\nusers to allow as many stakeholders as possibl e to adopt and apply project  results  across and beyond European \\nNatureCulture contact zones . #§COM -DIS-VIS-CDV§#\\nCall: [ HORIZON -CL6 -2024 -FARM2FORK -01-1] — [Agro -pastoral/outdoor livestock  systems and wildlife management ] \\n Part B - Page 32 of 50 2.3 Summary  \\nKEY ELEMENT S OF THE IMPACT SECTION  \\nSPECIFIC NEEDS  EXPECTED RESULTS  CD&E MEASURES  \\nCRITTER reacts to challenges exacerbating instances \\nof agriculture- wildlife conflict, including : \\n1: Accelerated loss of cultural farming heritage  \\n2: Growing risk for illegal killing  of wildlife  \\n3: Negative preconceptions and attitudes towards other \\nstakeholders  \\n4: Inadequate dialogue between stakeholders  \\n5: Inadequate data quality regarding livestock- wildlife \\nencounters and damages  \\n CRITTER proposes a shift from co nflicts  to more -than-\\nhuman co-habitation , through the  following Key \\nExploitable Results:  \\nKER1: An inventory of Best Practices  \\nKER2 : A harmonised approach for data collection and \\nreporting \\nKER3 : A database on wildlife management approaches \\nacross the EU  \\nKER4 : 5 NC2 modules \\nKER5 : Evidence of costs and benefits \\nKER6 : An integrative modelling framework  \\nKER7 : Policy recommendations  \\nKER 8: NC2 Hub for information, communication, and \\ncoordination  The project will leve rage the NC2 Hub for engaging \\nstakeholders and disseminating findings and methods \\ndeveloped during the project .  \\nThe multi -stakeholder approach involving key \\nstakeholders in LL activities ensures uptake of \\nknowledge in relevant environments.

The task is carried out in three steps.    \\nFirst,  the main wildlife and livestock farming managem ent approaches are identified preliminarily by using the \\ncollective knowledge of experts in the CRITTER  consortium. An onli ne consortium workshop will be organized to \\npreliminarily develop the framework guidi ng data collection for the review, and to explore the key information sources \\nfor collecting up -to-date data from countries in Europe.  \\nSecond , altogether up to 28 key informant interviews (7 LL countries, N=4/ country; interviewees representing \\ncompetent authorities, wildlife protection, practitioners o f farming and wildlife management) will be conducted to \\nfurther identify relevant policies and gain in -depth stakeholder kn owledge on wildlife and livestock management \\npractices, policies currently in place, co -existence, and conflicts, and to identify policy gaps. Standardised protocols \\nand consent forms will be prepared for the interviews by  Luke.   \\nThird , policy documents, scientific literature and existing national and European reviews and overview reports \\ndescribing the identified policies will be summa rised in English by respective in- country partner, and then analysed \\ncentrally by WWF to provide a detaile d description and synthesis of benefits and disadvantages of identified \\nmanagement approaches (including policy mixes, policy processes, strategies, instruments, governance, formal \\npositions (obligations, rights, decision power etc.) that practit ioners and decision makers in multi -level governance \\nstructures have as well as to categorise the types of management methods (e.g. adaptive, responsive, top -down, bottom -\\nup, co -management. lethal, non- lethal etc.). Identified knowledge gaps will be pointed out. A s ystematic review \\nconducted by LUKE  based on the PRISMA method will be used to review research publications.  \\nT 1.2 Mapping the most common types of wildlife damages to livestock farming and associated institutional \\narrangements  (M4-M12) – Lead:  LUKE / Participants: UNIPD, WWF, SFS  \\nThe most common damage types (e.g. dead animals, vehicle collisions, damages to structures such as housing or \\nfencing, disea se risks) suffered by livestock farmers, associated to large carnivores and ungulates, positive and negati ve \\nexternalities and institutional arrangements related to wildlife damages will be listed and described by using data \\nidentified in T1.1. Complementary information and information on externalities will be gathered via a survey that is \\nshared ele ctronically to experts in at least 7  countries where the project is implemented. A protocol to gather and \\nanalyse data will be developed by Luke.

Identifying and assessing hidden costs and ben efits of mitigation measures is \\nonly possible through direct involve ment of local stakeholders, allowing a co-creation of knowledge supported by \\nparticipative approaches t hat valorise the value of local knowledge and perspectives. Therefore, th is WP  uses as a \\ndistinguishing and novel approach a bottom -up CBA that be gins with identifying ecosystem services derived from \\nmitigation measures, analysing the socio -ecological problem and then assesses the costs and benefits of strategies \\nidentified by local stakeh olders and synthesise s them with financial and economic indicators.   \\nTask 7.1  Ecosystem conservation and environmental analysis (including ecosystem services ) (M25-M39) – \\nLead: UNIPD  /Participants : CITA, LUKE , SFS  \\nSynergies and trade -offs between wildlife and agro-pastoral systems in different regions and ecosystem s will be \\nanalysed by using participatory approaches that enable the identification and assessment of cultural ecosystem \\nservices related t o cultural heritage through eco- tourism and provisioning and regulating ecosystem services at a \\nsystem level (social, economic, environmental).  The value of agro- pastoral activities in terms of ecosystem services \\nwill be evalua ted in the different LL areas and estimated by using qualitative and quantitative approaches.   \\nTask 7.2  Participatory  cost-benefit analysis (including social, cultural , and economic benefits ) (M25-M39) – \\nLead: UNIPD  / Participants : CITA, LUKE , SFS  \\nIdentifying and assessing the costs a nd benefits of TTM  is only possible through the involvem ent of local \\nstakeholders and the co -creation of knowledge supported by participative approaches that valorise the value of local \\nexperience and perspectives . Task 7.2 therefore ado pts an innovative bottom -up approach which, instead of starting \\nwith a pre -defined set of mitigation measure options, begins with the an alysis of the socio -ecological problem and \\nthen assesses the costs and benefits of strategies identif ied by local stakeholders in pursuit of addressing this \\nproblem. In close coordination with WPs 4 and 5, task 7.2 leverages  participatory approaches involving local \\nstakeholders, allowing to capture in a more detailed way the costs and benefits of the diversity of cases and \\necosystems and mitigation measures foreseen based on a co -decision process. Such an approach is more  likely to be \\naccepted by the local society and are better adapted to local conditions  in NCCZS where reducing the negative \\noutcomes of e ncounters between agriculture and LCs largely depends on multi- sectorial collaborations to develop \\nstrategies that reduce the cost of predation, increasing the cost -effectiveness of productive activities in rural \\ncommunities, and creating suitable landscapes for large carnivores, particularly in areas that surround protected and \\nwilderness areas . The co -decision process and method develops in three  steps :    \\nStep 1:  co-design a list of all options of mitigation measures for each specific LL on the b asis of the results from \\nWP6  by detailing specificities of ecosystems and types of wildlife ma nagement approaches.    \\nStep 2:  Co-design a list of costs and benefits for each option. R8elevant stakeholders will clarify economic, social, \\nand environmental (and other relevant categories) costs and benefits. Within each category, both one -time and \\nrecurring costs and benefits will be identified and controlled to avoid double counting in different categories (e.g. \\nsocial and economic).    \\nStep 3:  Calculate the value of the costs and benefits. This step will require determining the timeline for the analysis  \\nand the quantification of costs and benefits for all the categories. There are cases where costs and benefits are not \\neasy to quantify. In this case, a pairwise ranking will be used to rank quantifiable and non -quantifiable costs and \\nbenefits. This will a llow us to identify where non-quantifiable values lie compared to the quantifiable values. The \\ngroup will then attribute a monetary value  based on the ranking.   \\nWork package number     8 \\nWork package title    Digital Twin (DT) modelling  & optimization - Lead: WUR  \\nObjective : develop and assess existing models explicating agriculture -wildlife encounters and associated  damages \\n(e.g. qualitative and (semi -)quantitative approaches, such as mental models, conceptual models, fuzzy cognitive \\nmaps, Bayesian Network model, occupancy models or multicriteria analyses, etc) in light of the needs and diversity \\nof NCCZs represented  in the LLs , further develop those models in a Digital Twin (DT) prototype along with \\nfurthering existing DT  prototypes ; test the prototypes in  the LL s, and create a generic modelling framework that \\ncould be adopted for use in various contexts.    \\nCall: [ HORIZON -CL6 -2024 -FARM2FORK -01-1] — [Agro -pastoral/outdoor livestock  systems and wildlife management ] \\n Part B - Page 41 of 50 Description of work    \\nT 8.1 DT models implementation and adjustment in Living Labs ( M19-M30)  – Lead: WUR / Participants: \\nCITA, LUKE  \\nParticipatory modelling will be applied in the development of Bayesian N etwork model(s) to study stakeholder \\nperceptions of wildlife management.

To further  mitigate this risk, Project Management  will coordinate \\nwith all WP leaders on  the identification of data needs before the WPs initiat e \\nthe collec tion of data. Where relevant, secondary/dummy  data  (e.g. c ase \\nstudies ) may be used as complementary source of information should data \\nobtained for the database be insufficient.  \\nAfter initial data collection  \\n(WP1) , the selected \\nNCCZs/LLs are found not to \\nbe sufficiently representative \\nof the EU context .  WP1 \\nWP3 \\n NCCZ/ LL selection in the project design phase has built on existing research - \\nand practitioner knowledge. To mitigate this risk  further nonetheless, EAB \\nmembers representing countries not included in the LLs have specifically been \\nselected .

Presence of in -\\ncountry partners, in- person contacts and the ability to communicate in local \\nlanguage will mitigate possible risks associated with the interviewee \\nrecruitments efficiently. To mitigate unwillingness due to the sensitivity of or \\npolar ization related to the topic, we will keep interviewees’ identities \\nconfidential and rely on multi- actor  facilitation practices from partners ’ \\nprevious work to create trustworthy research relationships. The key participants \\nwe have already identified have been active in public debates on LCs and \\nungulates, t herefore we expect that they will share data and contribute to the \\nprocess.   If necessary, the scope can be expanded to other countries.  \\nInadequate data available for \\nthe best practices inventor y \\nL=L | S=M  WP1 \\nWP2  In addition to key informant interviews and contacting possible data sources in \\nperson, the partners already have access to a substantial body of relevant \\ninformation, which will mitigate efficiently the risks insufficient qualitative \\ndata.

Building on \\nstakeholders’ lifeworlds means that their viewpoints and experiences guide the \\nproject, hence minimizing the imposition of top -down perspectives.  \\nSelf-selection bias where \\nindivid uals and groups \\nagreeing to participate in the \\nstudy are  not sufficiently  \\nrepresentative of the broader \\ngroup under study . \\nL=M | S=M  WP1  \\nWP2  \\nWP3  \\nWP4  \\nWP5  The project’s combination of qualitative and quantitative methods mitigates \\nthis risk, as qualitative data are supplemented where appropriate with surveys \\nfor wider  representati on. The inclusion of ethnographic methods and \\ndocumentary analyses further mitigates this risk through data triangulation. Finally, expert input fr om partners and EAB members representing specific \\nstakeholder groups  will inform participant selection and data analysis, \\nfacilitating access to a more diverse groups of study participants where needed.    \\nEthical dilemma s of data \\nprivacy, informed consent, \\nand participant well -being  \\nL=M | S=M  WP1  \\nWP2  \\nWP3 \\nWP4 \\nWP5  The Data Management Plan will outl ine and establish clear ethical guidelines, \\nwhich prioritise informed consent and participant safety. All project activities \\nwill be approved by Ethical Committee s of the Institutions participati ng in the \\nproject,  ensuring it follows the EU Ethical regulation  \\nInsufficient engagement from \\nstakeholders, which hinders \\nLL effectiveness. S takeholders  \\n(particularly farm ers) might  \\nresist adopting new \\ntechnologies or practices  \\n(TTM)  \\nL=M | S=H  \\n WP3 \\nWP4 \\nWP5  The project actively involves relevant local, regional, national , and European \\nparties from the outset. Farmers (key actors in the LLs) are already /members \\nof the project consortium, ensuring active participation. The expertise in facilitating collabora tive co-decision process and the network which project \\npartners su ch as DEM and CAMP bring to the project ensures that recruitment, \\ndecisions, and communication are attuned to the \\nstakeholders in rural \\ncommunities . The project’s specific focus on studying and mitigating the \\nburden that TTM implementation constitutes for farmers increases the \\nattractiveness of project participation . \\nA partner in charge of \\nimplementing a LL leaves the \\nconsortium  \\nL=L | S=H WP3  \\nWP4  \\nWP5  Mitigation measures for this risk will be dependent on the timing of the \\npartner’s exit. Before, or in the early stages of LL start -up, consortium  partners  \\nand EAB’s wide network across Europe  will allow  for the selection and \\nestablishment of a different LL site  fitting the characteristics of the missing LL. \\nIf such a LL cannot be found, data from existing  case studies will be included \\nto compensate for lacking data to the  extent possible . After LL start -up, Project \\nCall: [ HORIZON -CL6 -2024 -FARM2FORK -01-1] — [Agro -pastoral/outdoor livestock  systems and wildlife management ] \\n Part B - Page 47 of 50 Management will decide, in concert with  the lead for WPs 3 -5, whether \\nexisting par tners can take over research activities at the “orphan” LL or \\nwhether an additional partner needs to be recruited among partners’ and EAB’s \\nnetwork. If the partner’s exit takes place after the completion of WP4, the lead \\nfor WP5 will complete the tasks for this package in the “orphan” LL.  \\nDifficulty in assessin g the \\nLLs’ impact and effectiveness.  \\nL=M | S=M  WP3 \\nWP4 \\nWP5  \\nWP8  \\nWP9  Partners’ (e.g. CITA, UNIPD, DEM) extensive experience with LLs mitigates \\nthis risk  as partners have previously adopted this met hod for innovation \\ndevelopment and impact . CRITTER will define clear evaluation criteria  to use \\nacross LLs, collect relevant data, and analyse results systematically, both \\nqualitatively and quantitatively  by drawing on existing literature and practice .  \\nAssigning monetary values to \\nsocial be nefits in cost -benefit \\nanalys es involves subjective \\njudgment . Different \\nstakeholders may perceive \\nthese benefits differently, \\nresulting in  varying outcomes.  \\nL=M | S=M  WP6 \\nWP7 \\nWP9  The design of the participatory CBA reli es on a rigorous process for enabling \\nthe decision -making process on values entering the analysis , which includes \\nsystematized provision of guidelines a nd an iterative process of jointly arriving \\nat meaningful selection and voting criteria. Close coordination and \\ncollaboration with WPs 1 -5 ensure that participants’  lifeworlds are understood \\nfrom the outset  and can constructively be interrogated during the participat ory \\nCBA.  An aggregating sensitivity analysis (T 9.2) further mitigates this risk by \\ninvestigating how and to what extent values obtained in the participatory \\nprocess sca le in consequential ways to impact aggregating analyses and \\ndecision -making.  \\nCBA has an inherent risk of \\nomission  when  economic \\nvalue often extends beyond \\nfinancial metrics to intangible \\nfactors like cultural heritage, \\nmaking precise val uation \\nchallenging.  \\nL=M | S=M  WP6 \\nWP7   \\nWP9  CRITTER brings together experts from across Europe, with a long track record \\nin performing cost -benefit analys es in the case of natural resource manage ment \\n(i.e. UNIPD,  CITA, LUKE, SDU) . To inform their work and thereby mitigate \\nthis risk, interdisciplinary feedback on the CBA performed in this project wi ll \\nbe included. Specifically, the ethnographic methods used for exploring the \\ncomplexity of human- wildlife encounters in NCCZs (T 2.3) as well as the \\nextensive experience of conservation -focused partners such as WWF -BG and \\nWWF -SK will ensure that non-financial values are adequately included.  \\nThe diversity of the tested \\nmodelling approaches is too \\nextensi ve to allow combin ing, \\ngeneralis ing or \\noperationalis ing. \\nL=M | S=L  WP8, \\nWP9  The WP8&9 -lead will coordinat e among quantitative approaches  together with \\nWP participants to ensure good understanding of what each approach and institution can do , establish good agreements at the beginning of the project on \\n“ownership” of the work developed together.

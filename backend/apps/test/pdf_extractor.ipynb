      "Structure of the Proposal The proposal contains two parts:•Part A of the proposal is generated by the IT system. It is based on the information entered by the participants through the submission system in the Funding & Tenders Portal. The participants can update the information in the submission system at any time before final submission.  •Part B of the proposal is the narrative part that includes three sections that each correspond to an evaluation criterion. Part B needs to be uploaded as a PDF document following the templates downloaded by the applicants in the submission system for the specific call or topic. The templates for a specific call may slightly differ from the example provided in this document.The electronic submission system is an online wizard that guides you step-by-step through the preparation of your proposal. The submission process consists of 6 steps:- Step 1: Logging in the Portal - Step 2: Select the call, topic and type of action in the Portal- Step 3: Create a draft proposal: Title, acronym, summary, main organisation and contact details- Step 4: Manage your parties and contact details: add your partner organisations and contact details. - Step 5: Edit and complete web forms for proposal part A and upload proposal part B- Step 6: Submit the proposalHISTORY OF CHANGESVersionPublication dateChanges1.010.03.2021―Initial version1.119.04.2021―Formatting and alignment―Clariﬁcation of the indicative number of pages in section 2.2 is for sections 2.2 and 2.3―Added the name of the award criterion in section 31.225.05.2021―Addition of a table in section 3.1 about in-kind contributions2.021.01.2022―Changes in tables on section 3 avoiding duplication of information―Reorder of points in ‘Impact’ section3.011.07.2022―Consolidation, formatting and layout changes.

      "procedure.The structure of this template must be followed when preparing your proposal. It has been designed to ensure that the important aspects of your planned work are presented in a way that will enable the experts to make an effective assessment against the evaluation criteria. Sections 1, 2 and 3 each correspond to an evaluation criterion. Please be aware that proposals will be evaluated as they were submitted, rather than on their potential if certain changes were to be made. This means that only proposals that successfully address all the required aspects will have a chance of being funded. There will be no possibility for significant changes to content, budget and consortium composition during grant preparation. Page limit: The title, list of participants and sections 1, 2 and 3, together, should not be longer than 45 pages. For topics using lump sum funding, the limit is 50 pages. All tables, figures, references and any other element pertaining to these sections must be included as an integral part of these sections and are thus counted against this page limit. The number of pages included in each section of this template is only indicative. The page limit will be applied automatically. At the end of this document you can see the structure of the actual proposal that you need to submit, please remove all instruction pages that are watermarked. If you attempt to upload a proposal longer than the specified limit before the deadline, you will receive an automatic warning and will be advised to shorten and re-upload the proposal. After the deadline, excess pages (in over-long proposals/applications) will be automatically made invisible, and will not be taken into consideration by the experts. The proposal is a self-contained document.  Experts will be instructed to ignore hyperlinks to information that is specifically designed to expand the proposal, thus circumventing the page limit. Please, do not consider the page limit as a target! It is in your interest to keep your text as concise as possible, since experts rarely view unnecessarily long proposals in a positive light. The following formatting conditions apply. The reference font for the body text of proposals is Times New Roman (Windows platforms), Times/Times New Roman (Apple platforms) or Nimbus Roman No. 9 L (Linux distributions).The use of a different font for the body text is not advised and is subject to the cumulative conditions that the font is legible and that its use does not significantly shorten the representation of the proposal in number of pages compared to using the reference font (for example with a view to bypass the page limit).The minimum font size allowed is 11 points. Standard character spacing and a minimum of single line spacing is to be used. This applies to the body text, including text in tables.Text elements other than the body text, such as headers, foot/end notes, captions, formula's, may deviate, but must be legible.The page size is A4, and all margins (top, bottom, left, right) should be at least 15 mm (not including any footers or headers).This document is tagged. Be careful not to delete the tags; they are needed for processing.DEFINITIONS Critical riskA critical risk is a plausible event or issue that could have a high adverse impact on the ability of the project to achieve its objectives.   Level of likelihood to occur (Low/medium/high): The likelihood is the estimated probability that the risk will materialise even after taking account of the mitigating measures put in place.Level of severity (Low/medium/high): The relative seriousness of the risk and the signiﬁcance of its effect.\n",
      "DeliverableA report that is sent to the Commission or Agency providing information to ensure effective monitoring of the project. There are different types of deliverables (e.g. a report on speciﬁc activities or results, data management plans, ethics or security requirements). ImpactsWider long term effects on society (including the environment), the economy and science, enabled by the outcomes of R&I investments (long term). It refers to the speciﬁc contribution of the project to the work programme expected impacts described in the destination. Impacts generally occur some time after the end of the project.Example: The deployment of the advanced forecasting system enables each airport to increase maximum passenger capacity by 15% and passenger average throughput by 10%, leading to a 28% reduction in infrastructure expansion costs.MilestoneControl points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the achievement of a key result, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development. The achievement of a milestone should be veriﬁable.ObjectivesThe goals of the work performed within the project, in terms of its research and innovation content. This will be translated into the project’s results. These may range from tackling speciﬁc research questions, demonstrating the feasibility of an innovation, sharing knowledge among stakeholders on speciﬁc issues. The nature of the objectives will depend on the type of action, and the scope of the topic.OutcomesThe expected effects, over the medium term, of projects supported under a given topic.  The results of a project should contribute to these outcomes, fostered in particular by the dissemination and exploitation measures. This may include the uptake, diffusion, deployment, and/or use of the project’s results by direct target groups. Outcomes generally occur during or shortly after the end of the project.Example: 9 European airports adopt the advanced forecasting system demonstrated during the project.Pathway to impact Logical steps towards the achievement of the expected impacts of the project over time, in particular beyond the duration of a project. A pathway begins with the projects’ results, to their dissemination, exploitation and communication, contributing to the expected outcomes in the work programme topic, and ultimately to the wider scientiﬁc, economic and societal impacts of the work programme destination. Research  outputResults generated by the action to which access can be given in the form of scientiﬁc publications, data or other engineered outcomes and processes such as software, algorithms, protocols and electronic notebooks.ResultsWhat is generated during the project implementation. This may include, for example, know-how, innovative solutions, algorithms, proof of feasibility, new business models, policy recommendations, guidelines, prototypes, demonstrators, databases and datasets, trained researchers, new infrastructures, networks, etc. Most project results (inventions, scientiﬁc works, etc.) are ‘Intellectual Property’, which may, if appropriate, be protected by formal ‘Intellectual Property Rights’.Example: Successful large-scale demonstrator: trial with 3 airports of an advanced forecasting system for proactive airport passenger ﬂow management.Technology Readiness LevelSee Work Programme General Annexes B\n",

      "1. Excellence #@REL-EVA-RE@#Excellence – aspects to be taken into account.−Clarity and pertinence of the project’s objectives, and the extent to which the proposed work is ambitious, and goes beyond the state of the art.−Soundness of the proposed methodology, including the underlying concepts, models, assumptions, interdisciplinary approaches, appropriate consideration of the gender dimension in research and innovation content, and the quality of open science practices, including sharing and management of research outputs and engagement of citizens, civil society and end users where appropriate.The following aspects will be taken into account only to the extent that the proposed work is within the scope of the work programme topic.1.1 Objectives and ambition #@PRJ-OBJ-PO@# [e.g. 4 pages]•Brieﬂy describe the objectives of your proposed work. Why are they pertinent to the work programme topic? Are they measurable and veriﬁable? Are they realistically achievable?•Describe how your project goes beyond the state-of-the-art, and the extent the proposed work is ambitious. Indicate any exceptional ground-breaking R&I, novel concepts and approaches, new products, services or business and organisational models. Where relevant, illustrate the advance by referring to products and services already available on the market. Refer to any patent or publication search carried out.•Describe where the proposed work is positioned in terms of R&I maturity (i.e. where it is situated in the spectrum from ‘idea to application’, or from ‘lab to market’). Where applicable, provide an indication of the Technology Readiness Level, if possible distinguishing the start and by the end of the project.Please bear in mind that advances beyond the state of the art must be interpreted in the light of the positioning of the project. Expectations will not be the same for RIAs at lower TRL, compared with Innovation Actions at high TRLs. #§PRJ-OBJ-PO§#1.2 Methodology #@CON-MET-CM@# #@COM-PLE-CP@# [e.g. 14 pages]•Describe and explain the overall methodology, including the concepts, models and assumptions that underpin your work. Explain how this will enable you to deliver your project’s objectives. Refer to any important challenges you may have identiﬁed in the chosen methodology and how you intend to overcome them. [e.g. 10  pages]This section should be presented as a narrative. The detailed tasks and work packages are described below under ‘Implementation’. Where relevant, include how the project methodology complies with the ‘do no signiﬁcant harm’ principle as per Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (i.e. the so-called 'EU Taxonomy Regulation'). This means that the methodology is designed in a way it is not signiﬁcantly harming any of the six environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.If you plan to use, develop and/or deploy artiﬁcial intellingence (AI) based systems and/or techniques you must demonstrate their technical robustness. AI-based systems or techniques should be, or be developed to become: •technically robust, accurate and reproducible, and able to deal with and inform about possible failures, inaccuracies and errors, proportionate to the assessed risk they pose •socially robust, in that they duly consider the context and environment in which \n",
      "they operate •reliable and function as intended, minimizing unintentional and unexpected harm, preventing unacceptable harm and safeguarding the physical and mental integrity of humans •able to provide a suitable explanation of their decision-making processes, whenever they can have a signiﬁcant impact on people’s lives.•Describe any national or international research and innovation activities whose results will feed into the project, and how that link will be established; [e.g. 1 page]•Explain how expertise and methods from different disciplines will be brought together and integrated in pursuit of your objectives. If you consider that an inter-disciplinary approach is unnecessary in the context of the proposed work, please provide a justiﬁcation. [e.g. 1/2 page]•For topics where the work programme indicates the need for the integration of social sciences and humanities, show the role of these disciplines in the project or provide a justiﬁcation if you consider that these disciplines are not relevant to your proposed project. [e.g. 1/2 page]•Describe how the gender dimension (i.e. sex and/or gender analysis) is taken into account in the project’s research and innovation content [e.g. 1 page]. If you do not consider such a gender dimension to be relevant in your project, please provide a justiﬁcation.  Note: This section is mandatory except for topics which have been identiﬁed in the work programme as not requiring the integration of the gender dimension into R&I content.Remember that that this question relates to the content of the planned research and innovation activities, and not to gender balance in the teams in charge of carrying out the project.Sex and gender analysis refers to biological characteristics and social/cultural factors respectively. For guidance on methods of sex / gender analysis and the issues to be taken into account, please refer to https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/gendered-innovations-2-2020-nov-24_en•Describe how appropriate open science practices are implemented as an integral part of the proposed methodology. Show how the choice of practices and their implementation are adapted to the nature of your work, in a way that will increase the chances of the project delivering on its objectives [e.g. 1 page]. If you believe that none of these practices are appropriate for your project, please provide a justiﬁcation here. Open science is an approach based on open cooperative work and systematic sharing of knowledge and tools as early and widely as possible in the process. Open science practices include early and open sharing of research (for example through preregistration, registered reports, pre-prints, or crowd-sourcing); research output management; measures to ensure reproducibility of research outputs; providing open access to research outputs (such as publications, data, software, models, algorithms, and workﬂows); participation in open peer-review; and involving all relevant knowledge actors including citizens, civil society and end users in the co-creation of R&I agendas and contents (such as citizen science).Please note that this question does not refer to outreach actions that may be planned as part of communication, dissemination and exploitation activities. These aspects should instead be described below under ‘Impact’.•Research data management and management of other research outputs: Applicants generating/collecting data and/or other research outputs (except for publications) during the project must provide maximum 1 page on how the data/ research outputs will be managed in line with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), addressing the following \n",
      "(the description should be speciﬁc to your project): [1 page]Types of data/research outputs (e.g. experimental, observational, images, text, numerical) and their estimated size; if applicable, combination with, and provenance of, existing data.Findability of data/research outputs: Types of persistent and unique identiﬁers (e.g. digital object identiﬁers) and trusted repositories that will be used.Accessibility of data/research outputs: IPR considerations and timeline for open access (if open access not provided, explain why); provisions for access to restricted data for veriﬁcation purposes.Interoperability of data/research outputs: Standards, formats and vocabularies for data and metadata.Reusability of data/research outputs:  Licenses for data sharing and re-use (e.g. Creative Commons, Open Data Commons); availability of tools/software/models for data generation and validation/interpretation /re-use.Curation and storage/preservation costs; person/team responsible for data management and quality assurance. Proposals selected for funding under Horizon Europe will need to develop a detailed data management plan (DMP) for making their data/research outputs ﬁndable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) as a deliverable by month 6 and revised towards the end of a project’s lifetime. For guidance on open science practices and research data management, please refer to the relevant section of the HE Programme Guide on the Funding & Tenders Portal.#@CON-MET-CM@# #@COM-PLE-CP@#2. Impact #@IMP-ACT-IA@#Impact – aspects to be taken into account.−Credibility of the pathways to achieve the expected outcomes and impacts speciﬁed in the work programme, and the likely scale and signiﬁcance of the contributions due to the project.−Suitability and quality of the measures to maximise expected outcomes and impacts, as set out in the dissemination and exploitation plan, including communication activities.The results of your project should make a contribution to the expected outcomes set out for the work programme topic over the medium term, and to the wider expected impacts set out in the ‘destination’ over the longer term. In this section you should show how your project could contribute to the outcomes and impacts described in the work programme, the likely scale and signiﬁcance of this contribution, and the measures to maximise these impacts.2.1 Project’s pathways towards impact [e.g. 4 pages]•Provide a narrative explaining how the project’s results are expected to make a difference in terms of impact, beyond the immediate scope and duration of the project. The narrative should include the components below, tailored to your project. \n",
      "(a) Describe the unique contribution your project results would make towards (1) the outcomes speciﬁed in this topic, and (2) the wider impacts, in the longer term, speciﬁed in the respective destinations in the work programme.   Be speciﬁc, referring to the effects of your project, and not R&I in general in this ﬁeld. State the target groups that would beneﬁt. Even if target groups are mentioned in general terms in the work programme, you should be speciﬁc here, breaking target groups into particular interest groups or segments of society relevant to this project.The outcomes and impacts of your project may:•Scientiﬁc, e.g. contributing to speciﬁc scientiﬁc advances, across and within disciplines, creating new knowledge, reinforcing scientiﬁc equipment and instruments,  computing systems (i.e. research infrastructures);•Economic/technological, e.g. bringing new products, services, business processes to the market, increasing efﬁciency, decreasing costs, increasing proﬁts, contributing to standards’ setting,  etc. •Societal , e.g. decreasing CO2 e m i s s i o n s ,  d e c r e a s i n g  a v o i d a b l e  m o r t a l i t y ,  improving policies and decision making, raising consumer awareness.Only include such outcomes and impacts where your project would make a signiﬁcant and direct contribution. Avoid describing very tenuous links to wider impacts. However, include any potential negative environmental outcome or impact of the project including when expected results are brought at scale (such as at commercial level). Where relevant, explain how the potential harm can be managed.(b)  Give an indication of the scale and signiﬁcance of the project’s contribution to the expected outcomes and impacts, should the project be successful.  Provide quantiﬁed estimates where possible and meaningful.‘Scale’ refers to how widespread the outcomes and impacts are likely to be. For example, in terms of the size of the target group, or the proportion of that group, that should beneﬁt over time; ‘Signiﬁcance’ refers to the importance, or value, of those beneﬁts. For example, number of additional healthy life years; efﬁciency savings in energy supply.Explain your baselines, benchmarks and assumptions used for those estimates. Wherever possible, quantify your estimation of the effects that you expect from your project. Explain assumptions that you make, referring for example to any relevant studies or statistics. Where appropriate, try to use only one methodology for calculating your estimates: not different methodologies for each partner, region or country (the extrapolation should preferably be prepared by one partner).Your estimate must relate to this project only - the effect of other initiatives should not be taken into account.(c) Describe any requirements and potential barriers - arising from factors beyond the scope and duration of the project - that may determine whether the desired outcomes and impacts are achieved. These may include, for example, other R&I work within and beyond Horizon Europe; regulatory environment; targeted markets; user behaviour. Indicate if these factors might evolve over time. Describe any mitigating measures you propose, within or beyond your project, that could be needed should your assumptions prove to be wrong, or to address identiﬁed barriers. Note that this does not include the critical risks inherent to the management of the project itself , which should be described below under ‘Implementation’.\n",
      "2.2 Measures to maximise impact - Dissemination, exploitation and communication #@COM-DIS-VIS-CDV@# [e.g. 5 pages, including section 2.3]•Describe the planned measures to maximise the impact of your project by providing a ﬁrst version of your ‘plan for the dissemination and exploitation including communication activities’. Describe the dissemination, exploitation and communication measures that are planned, and the target group(s) addressed (e.g. scientiﬁc community, end users, ﬁnancial actors, public at large). Please remember that this plan is an admissibility condition, unless the work programme topic explicitly states otherwise. In case your proposal is selected for funding, a more detailed ‘plan for dissemination and exploitation including communication activities’ will need to be provided as a mandatory project deliverable within 6 months after signature date. This plan shall be periodically updated in alignment with the project’s progress. Communication measures should promote the project throughout the full lifespan of the project. The aim is to inform and reach out to society and show the activities performed, and the use and the beneﬁts the project will have for citizens. Activities must be strategically planned, with clear objectives, start at the outset and continue through the lifetime of the project. The description of the communication activities needs to state the main messages as well as the tools and channels that will be used to reach out to each of the chosen target groups.All measures should be proportionate to the scale of the project, and should contain concrete actions to be implemented both during and after the end of the project, e.g. standardisation activities. Your plan should give due consideration to the possible follow-up of your project, once it is ﬁnished. In the justiﬁcation, explain why each measure chosen is best suited to reach the target group addressed. Where relevant, and for innovation actions, in particular, describe the measures for a plausible path to commercialise the innovations.If exploitation is expected primarily in non-associated third countries, justify by explaining how that exploitation is still in the Union’s interest.Describe possible feedback to policy measures generated by the project that will contribute to designing, monitoring, reviewing and rectifying (if necessary) existing policy and programmatic measures or shaping and supporting the implementation of new policy initiatives and decisions.•Outline your strategy for the management of intellectual property, foreseen protection measures, such as patents, design rights, copyright, trade secrets, etc., and how these would be used to support exploitation.If your project is selected, you will need an appropriate consortium agreement to manage (amongst other things) the ownership and access to key knowledge (IPR, research data etc.). Where relevant, these will allow you, collectively and individually, to pursue market opportunities arising from the project.If your project is selected, you must indicate the owner(s) of the results (results ownership list) in the ﬁnal periodic report.#§COM-DIS-VIS-CDV§#2.3 Summary Provide a summary of this section by presenting in the canvas below the key elements of your project impact pathway and of the measures to maximise its impact.KEY ELEMENT OF THE IMPACT SECTION\n",
      "SPECIFIC NEEDSWhat are the speciﬁc needs that triggered this project?Example 1Most airports use process ﬂow-oriented models based on static mathematical values limiting the optimal management of passenger ﬂow and hampering the accurate use of the available resources to the actual demand of passengers.Example 2Electronic components need to get smaller and lighter to match the expectations of the end-users. At the same time there is a problem of sourcing of raw materials that has an environmental impact. D & E & C MEASURESWhat dissemination, exploitation and communication measures will you apply to the results? Example 1Exploitation: Patenting the algorithmic model. Dissemination towards the scientiﬁc community and airports: Scientiﬁc publication with the results of the large-scale demonstration. Communication towards citizens: An event in a shopping mall to show how the outcomes of the action are relevant to our everyday lives.Example 2Exploitation of the new product:  Patenting the new product;Licencing to major electronic companies. Dissemination towards the scientiﬁc community and industry: Participating at conferences; Developing a platform of material compositions for industry; Participation at EC project portfolios to disseminate the results as part of a group and maximise the visibility vis-à-vis companies.EXPECTED RESULTS\n",

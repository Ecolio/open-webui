      "Yes, I can see a few issues with this document. There are no specific guidelines that indicate when the document is for. The information could be applied to people of any age or experience level and it doesn't have any guidance on how long it should take to read through the entire content. There isn't even an introduction in this article. It starts off with the statement that this is a 10 minute lesson plan, which helps somewhat but I still need to know what I am supposed to be doing while I read this document. The objectives are also not clear and if there was some kind of scenario or activity at the start it would give me a better idea of how to use this as my guide. It could have been written in a more detailed and organized fashion than this. There is no clear plan for what to do while reading this document, so that makes it hard to read through without any specific ideas on where I should be in the process at each step.\n"

      "*  **Lack of Context:** The document lacks information about the projects' goals and objectives, making it harder to understand the significance of each cost item.\n",
      "*  **Unclear Acronyms:**  Abbreviations like  \"LL,\"  \"PPGIS,\" and  \"WP\" are used without definition, potentially confusing readers unfamiliar with the project.\n",
      "*  **Dense Detail:** The level of detail for each task and sub-task could be overwhelming for someone new to the project. \n",
      "*  **Missing Units and Context for Figures:**  The absence of units for monetary values and lack of context for figures (e.g., number of participants per travel) can lead to misinterpretations.\n",
      "*  **Justification Ambiguity:** While the  \"Justification\" column provides insights, a broader summary of its meaning in relation to project goals would be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*  **Define Acronyms:** Provide definitions for acronyms used throughout the document. \n",
      "*  **Add Project Context:** Briefly explain the goals and objectives of the DOGA and AECRANI projects.\n",
      "*  **Summarize Justifications:** Offer a concise summary of its meaning within the broader project context.\n",
      "*  **Contextualize Costs:**  Provide brief descriptions next to each cost type, explaining the activities covered and their necessity for project objectives. \n",
      "*  **Specify Units and Context for Figures:** Clearly state the units for monetary values and provide context for figures to avoid ambiguity.\n",
      "*  **Consider Visual Aids:**  Utilize charts or graphs to present cost breakdowns in a more visually appealing and understandable manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing these recommendations, the document can become more informative, accessible, and impactful for a wider audience.\n"

From this perspective, other beings than humans are part of social landscapes, and hence best approached in terms of encounters and interactions. \n",

      "Urban sprawl, along with the deterioration of natural habitats has forced large carnivores (LCs) into closer contact with human dwellings in the quest for sustenance, leading to an increased number of livestock depredations. In 2021 more than 55.000 farm animals (e.g. sheep, cattle, poultry, reindeer) were killed by wolves and other large carnivores in several European countries, corresponding to about 140 depredated animals per wolf alone3. At the same time, it is difficult to estimate the number of illegally killed large carnivores across Europe, but it has been recognised as a serious threat in many European countries4. This tableau is indicative of a \"wicked problem\": on one hand, conservation efforts have resulted in the flourishing of wild animal populations (including predatory carnivores), but on the other hand, farmers and herders have been facing livestock damages and economic loss. Thus, EU's farm-tofork and biodiversity 2030 strategies have in effect led to increased **agriculture-wildlife conflicts (AWCs)** and polarization amongst stakeholders, which have resulted in: \n",
      "- Accelerated **loss of cultural farming heritage**: attrition of traditional outdoor farming activities due to small farmers' difficulty in mobilizing the economic but also time resources to successfully manage conflicts with wildlife.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Growing risk for illegal killing **of LCs:** due to negative, fearful perceptions of and attitudes towards large carnivores both in areas of continued presence of these carnivores and areas where they have reappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "AWCs are often conceptualized as a two-party conflict, pitting agro-pastoral communities and their livestock against wildlife management and large carnivores. \"Conflict\" as such, is mitigated in various ways across Europe, with divergences that hinge on the cultural, economic, and legislative circumstances in the country and region in question. \n",
      "\n",
      "This poses challenges with regards to monitoring data on wildlife conservation and livestock-wildlife encounters, as methods for collecting data depend on local legislation. Although there have been international and European efforts to collaborate and share knowledge to adequately design mitigation policies, there is still insufficient knowledge of their effect at the local (farm) level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many good technical, infrastructural, and economic solutions have been developed to protect outdoors livestock, or otherwise equip farmers and conservation actors, including enclosures for free-ranging systems and electric fences for pastures, cameras and GPS monitoring og wildlife movement, or compensating for damages from predation of large carnivores. However, the adoption and implementation of these solutions often face failure - and thus insufficient effectiveness, due to a combination of different human factors, notably: \n",
      "- **Negative preconceptions and attitudes towards other stakeholders** (e.g., farmers vs. conservationists, hunters vs. advocates of animal protection) hindering coordination among all the involved actors. These preconceptions and attitudes emerge from factors at individual, social as well as cultural level, harmful images, and narratives, e.g. relative to both large carnivores and other stakeholders, precluding constructive communication and effective decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Inadequate dialogue between stakeholders** might result in insufficient, incomplete, or incorrect information which hinders optimal decision-making both on individual stakeholders' sides and at broader, regional, national, or European levels. Inadequate dialogue creates the feeling among local stakeholders of policy decisions being made without considering different stakeholders' interests, and how this may lead to larger conflicts both among human actors and with nature. It tends to result in a farmers' lack of trust in governmental bodies, and particularly EU (environmental) policies, as recurrent farmer demonstrations across the EU highlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Various projects and initiatives have been in part successful in locally resolving these issues (see 'R&I activities feeding into the project's methodology). Examples from individual local contexts indicate that AWCs can be mitigated through in-depth dialogue with all involved stakeholders to better address their needs and challenges. \n",
      "\n",
      "Successful approaches share an ability to generate the willingness to engage with *the Other* in a way that improves coordination between stakeholders, enabling the successful adoption and implementation of conflict mitigation strategies. But as encouraging as these individual, geographically scattered examples are, we lack a wide-ranging and successful aggregation of solutions at the European level.

      "Throughout Western history, human relationships with nature have been complex and led to both well-being and conflict. Nature's resources have been harnessed for prosperity, which has led to resource depletion, habitat loss, and climate change. Balancing these impacts with our well-being remains a challenge. An acute instance of this dilemma between nature uses and conservation has emerged in Europe at the meeting point of outdoor agricultural systems and the conservation of large carnivores. Resolving this dilemma has traditionally been approached from the angle of conflict prevention and management (CPM). Yet despite valuable efforts for improving CPM, academic as well as field experience indicate that a deeper change in human relationships with nature may be required. This project's ambition is to induce a paradigm shift in approaching encounters between outdoor agricultural systems and large carnivores, moving beyond CPM to enhancing **cohabitation** \n",

Historically, local populations across Europe drew on traditional knowledge for CPM, but such knowledge has largely disappeared throughout the twentieth century, which along with a shifted focus towards the conservation of large carnivores has significantly changed farmers' possibilities to mitigate challenges associated with increasing carnivore populations5. Conservation concerns have largely instigated a shift from lethal, eradication-based solutions to non-lethal CPM solutions such as (electric) fences, deterrents and other early warning systems, monitoring systems, livestock-guarding dogs, herdsmen and zoning management systems, although selective culling complements these non-lethal solutions. Monetary/non-monetary compensations and incentives also constitute an important element of such CPM6. Despite their importance, we identify four interconnected drawbacks relative to these CPM solutions: A. **Insufficient attention on local stakeholders' needs and challenges for CPM.** Successful implementation of CPM demands substantial time and financial investment: it requires organisational, technical, and economic changes, and for farmers to modify well-established practices of livestock and grazing management. Small-scale farmers are especially challenged when implementing such solutions despite financial incentives. These indirect costs of mitigation measures are often not compensated in initiatives such as the CAP Rural Development Plans7. Limited peer-reviewed scientific research has investigated different livestock farming systems' potential (from high to nil) to implement \"standard\" damage prevention measures, even if valuable field-level action has taken place in the past for resolving this issue8. However, there is limited understanding of livestock farming systems' highly variable possibility to fulfil the consequent needs to labour and modifying their livestock and grazing management practices. What needs to be studied is therefore not simply the prevention measures, but the complex interface of prevention measures with livestock systems, smallholders, and part time farmers as key stakeholders requiring specific focus. B. **Insufficient focus on goodwill and dialogue between (and among) local and regional stakeholders** CPM hinges on the goodwill of local stakeholders as well as the severity of sanctions towards illegally killing large carnivores9. Existing research shows polarized perceptions of, as well as attitudes and emotional orientations towards large carnivores (LC)10, with some stakeholders viscerally opposed to carnivore presence while others are welcoming. On the affective level, emotions such as fear or admiration play a prominent role in stakeholders' polarization of attitudes11. As a consequence, much effort on debunking incorrect facts or changing individual attitudes regarding LC often prove unsuccessful or even counter-productive, generating heightened resistance to dialogue rather than a fact-based, respectful discussion of conflicting viewpoints, not least as stakeholders such as farming communities might distrust such initiatives when they originate from nature conservation institutions. When CPM is seen as a predominantly technological or biological problem solved by rational cost-benefit assessments, the emotional, spatial, and cultural dimensions of interactions between humans and wildlife thus risk being deprioritized12. As LC are a very sentimental issue both for residents and practitioners resisting their penetration to their neighbourhoods, and for actors pursuing their preservation, it is essential for CPM to enable convivial dialogues to assess the diverse values, emotions, and needs of stakeholders and other actors, an aspect not given sufficient attention previously. Socio-demographic factors such as gender or class, as well as cultural factors such as subcultural clashes (e.g. environmental or hunting cultures13) have shown to further influence the valence of individuals' attitudes towards large carnivores14.Finally, the number and type of stakeholders' direct interactions with large carnivores appear to shape these stakeholders' attitudes, where direct experiences and close proximity with large carnivores can negatively impact stakeholders' attitudes15 and on the other hand continuous close contact between humans and large carnivores, such close proximity leads to increased tolerance of LC and support for their conservation16. These factors need to be brought together for successfully addressing the encounter of agricultural and wildlife. C. **Inadequacy of Conflict as a foundational concept** A growing number of studies argue that one of the main obstacles to successful CPM lies in a misinterpretation of the concept of *conflict17* between humans and LC. On one hand, conflict is inadequately defined. What is presented as a human vs. animal conflict is in most cases a human vs. human conflict, where opposing viewpoints are insufficiently acknowledged and resolved. Conflicts among farmers, environmentalists, authorities, and local populations tend to lie at the core of the unsuccessful management of agriculture-wildlife conflicts. It is therefore crucial to distinguish *human–wildlife impacts* from *human–human conflicts18*. This issue intersects with drawback \n",
      "(B) above. Despite their advantages, technological solutions are insufficient for adequately resolving agriculturewildlife conflicts if the human-human, social and cultural conflicts arising in agriculture-wildlife encounters are not considered as aspects of CPM19.

      "\n",
      "A small, but growing number of projects feature similar ambitions to the ones in the present project23. Besides controlling the encounter of wildlife and livestock, some initiatives increasingly pay attention to the human-human conflicts which may arise because of wildlife-livestock interactions. In many countries, discussion forums have for instance been established to ventilate the different values and needs of stakeholders and other actors. But despite offering promising results, such projects have remained context-specific, and do not provide actionable avenues for scaling the methodologies adopted in these projects to a broader, European level. Anecdotal evidence suggests that such dialogue-based approaches to conflict resolution and management work best at the local level as the issues at hand can be very personal to local residents. While regional and EU-level platforms exist, the latter tend to be strongly focused on political debate, which local-level stakeholders are wary of. Other existing conventions and networks (Council of Europe Bern Convention, EU Habitats Directive, Emerald, Natura 2000) aim at improving cross-border coordination, but individual nations' implementation of these conventions is poor. Instead of introducing an additional European-level political platform, CRITTER delivers a diverse toolbox for decisionmakers to optimally involve stakeholders at the local level, while allowing local stakeholders' experiences to be shared across contexts. \n",

Our ambition in this project is to provide actionable recommendations targeting policyand other decision-makers which allow them to enhance **cohabitation at the wider European level.** We expect that these recommendations will remain context-dependent to some extent. They do not aim at homogenizing TTM adopted across contexts, but delineate a combination of tools, methods, and processes to be implemented across European countries, conducive to improve understanding, dialogue and coordination, and thus ultimately decisionmaking between stakeholders at local and regional level.\n",

However, when approached from the theoretical angle of Multispecies Relations Studies, cohabitation is not to be seen as free of wildlife-induced damages or conflicts between (human) stakeholders. To the contrary, cohabitation represents a messy set of interactions, where outcomes detrimental to some or all parties are not minimized, but where the different stakeholders' unique realities are acknowledged and respected as valuable contributions to complex ecosystems, as actors being encouraged to take an orientation towards developing long-lasting solutions24. \n",

NatureCulture highlights that \"nature\" and \"culture\" are mutually dependent and constitutive rather than mutually exclusive. Landscapes, (agricultural) practices or human agglomerations are constituted in interactions between human and \"other-than-human\" beings, rather than in opposition to them. Framing the problem at hand from a perspective where multiple human and other-than-human stakeholders' needs are approached as interdependent and intersecting then means that resolving the challenges inherent to these intersections requires moving beyond categories that rigidify antagonist understandings of other stakeholders. The project combines the concept of NatureCulture with the concept of **contact zone26**, describing a diversity of relations between different subjects, creating an assemblage shaped by historical, cultural, ecological, and evolutionary conditions. When human and other-than-human subjects are present and interact in contact zones they are constituted in and by their relations to each other; a process often exhibiting asymmetrical relations of power27. \n",

Such a focus on cohabitation has a natural compatibility with Multispecies Relations Studies, in that the latter's focus likewise lies on decentring the human, moving societal as well as academic attention away from anthropocentric perspectives towards perspectives acknowledging the inextricable co-constitution of ecosystems and the interdependency of humans and other-than-humans. \n",

A fundamental novelty inherent to adopting the NatureCulture **concept** as foundational to this project when it comes to the encounters between agriculture and wildlife conservation is that it includes farmers and their organisations not as beneficiaries of measures, but as active participants along with other human and other-than-human stakeholders in the co-creation of the conditions and measures to enhance the cohabitation of human and other-than-human species in their contexts. \n",

      "\n",
      "Given the need to integrate multiple sources of insight - biological, ecological, sociological, economic, and agricultural, to name a few - interdisciplinary approaches to knowledge creation and activation are indispensable for CRITTER. Disciplines from SSH, Agricultural Science, Natural Resource Management and Conservation Sciences form the core of this project. Agricultural and conservation science are crucial for grounding the project in existing knowledge, tools, and technologies for optimizing the encounter between agriculture and LCs, existing work having addressed coexistence and sustainable use aspects. SSH (particularly the multispecies research approach at the basis of the paradigm shift this project proposes) offers a substantive contribution in critically interrogating existing assumptions about human relations with other species. Such an interrogation is conducive to addressing the problem at hand in a way that multiple stakeholders lifeworlds are actively drawn into the enhancement of cohabitation. The research methods adopted for such a collaborative and non-human-centric approach to knowledge creation and impact aim at generating, analysing, and bringing together various kinds of data, from biological to cultural, historical, and statistical ones at all stages of the project methodology. We combine diverse research methods, from surveys, statistics and modelling to qualitative relational methods developed for exploring multispecies relations and more traditional methods such as interviews. Scrutinizing the contact zones requires the use of rich, complex modes of analysis that entangles material and discursive, natural and cultural, biological and textual, and numerical and narrative31. For instance, to understand the interaction between humans and wolves, the research team might use and combine GPS data of wolves' movements, biological data of their species-specific behaviour in that particular area, farmers' and other stakeholders' situated knowledge and attitudes as well as cultural narratives concerning wolves. \n",

      "Such data are put in a creative dialogue in iterative multidisciplinary analytic sessions to be organized. Using different types and modalities of data and combining creatively ways of analysing (e.g. taking a narrative approach to measurements) enables gaining a multi-sided and novel understanding of the interactions and entanglements that take place in the contact zone. A challenge usually arising with such an approach is the one of adequately accessing morethan-human agency and knowledge or co-creating knowledge with animals (and other species). Most scientific methods32 hinge on human interpretation and as such are only partial representations of the lived reality of otherthan-humans. The project addresses this by deploying multiple methods, including novel nonrepresentational, sensory, and other narrative methods that enable going beyond fully anthropocentric modes of knowing and learning. We are aware of the partiality and situatedness of the knowledge that we generate with all of our stakeholders (human and other-than-human) and aim to achieve as complete a representation as possible and to identify as well as explicate power dynamics in the research process. Challenges related to interdisciplinarity amongst the research team might arise, in relation to using different conceptual vocabularies and to working within different (even disparate) paradigms in ways that might complicate commensurability and collective knowledge generation. Yet all consortium partners have extensive experience with interdisciplinary work, which renders them able to understand and engage with other disciplines' approaches, therefore this challenge is relatively limited. Also, time will be dedicated in project meetings to acknowledge differences across and within disciplines, value different disciplinary contributions and create trust to enable partners to approach initial ambiguities around terminology in an open-minded way. \n",

      "## Step 1 - Enriching And Consolidating European-Level **Nccz Knowledge**\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of this first step is to establish a consolidated and harmonized overview of existing knowledge and good practices which considers the results of previous and ongoing initiatives and deepens these existing insights by combining them with an in-depth study of stakeholders' lifeworlds in 10 NCCZs. The resulting inventory of best practices and infrastructures (SO1) incorporates multiple stakeholders' (farmers, hunters, carnivores, livestock, conservationists, general public, policy makers) unique and potentially diverging contextual needs. Practically, this step combines three methodological approaches in line with the scope stated for the topic, namely (1) Reviewing existing knowledge relative to agriculture-wildlife interactions in the different EU Member States and Associated Countries, (2) Drawing up a methodology for collecting and reporting comparable data at the European level, (3) Performing an in-depth, ethnographic analysis of stakeholders' lifeworlds, situating best practices in stakeholders' circumstances, needs and challenges. To do so, this step brings the following methods together: \n",
      "Content analyses of existing academic as well as practitioner literature and project reports, as well as **discourse** \n",
      "analyses of existing cultural narratives relative to large carnivores (selected fiction and non-fiction literature, news, and social media). For the latter, cultural narratives, including fiction literature as much as social media debates, provide a valuable source of insights regarding how multiple stakeholders conceive of multispecies relations, and specifically relations between humans and large carnivores. Much of the recent literature has recognized the transformative potential of stories in recasting human-animal relations, for instance questioning the protagonist role of the human in powerful cultural stories33, a deeper engagement with these narratives offering the potential to transformed relations between species and nurture new social imaginaries34 for more just futures. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ethnographic methods include interviews with human stakeholders (farmers, hunters, conservationists, members of the general public, policy makers), as well as participant observation in farming, hunting, and conservation activities35. Phenomenological interviews36 serve to uncover the lifeworlds of human stakeholders in relation to wildlife encounters in agropastoral settings and will identify existing and diverse values and conceptualizations, emotions, and experiences related to nature, wildlife, other-than-human beings that the human stakeholders hold and act upon. This portion reveals existing ideological as well as practical challenges, barriers, and gaps towards transitioning to a cohabitation-oriented approach. \n",
      "\n",
      "Relational, participative methods implemented in collaboration with natural scientists and social scientists37, strengthen the project's sensitivity to the diverse realities, needs and challenges core to multi-stakeholder and especially multi-species approaches. For these methods, the project refers to recent studies on human-animal relations38 to focus on the way Human-OH relations are signified and practiced in NCCZs. These methods may include mobile videographies39, art-based inquiries40, collaborative memory-work methods41 as well as collaborative storytelling *with* rather than about OH beings42, specifically livestock and carnivores. These methods offer the advantage of providing a more holistic understanding of the agencies, actions, and interactions of OH species as coproducers of the NCCZs. This includes carnivores and livestock but also other plant and animal species as well as geo-physical elements of the landscape such as bodies of water and soil. Challenges related to skills required for situated and relational epistemology in qualitative inquiry may arise, which methodological training will alleviate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Harmonization and improvement of existing information: Because information is available in both formal and informal formats, multiple methods will be utilised to deliver the inventory of best practices and policies. Workshops and semi-structured key informant interviews with a standardised interview protocol applied across countries will be the key to obtain informal and silent knowledge concerning wildlife management practices and policies in Europe. This will be followed by a survey to the key experts in different EU member states. Further, published studies and official documents will be essential to summarise formal evidence on concerning wildlife management practices and policies in Europe. A systematic review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) method will be used to synthesise documented information. PRISMA allows authors to improve the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses and is a preferred approach in reporting review results. A \n",
      "combination of systematic reviews, qualitative workshops and interviews will help identify knowledge and data gaps. Combined, these methods provide the basis for setting up an inventory of relevant practices and policies applied in wildlife and agro-pastoral systems. By further processing the data and appraising different practices and policies, success stories and best practices can be identified. This will also provide data concerning different types of damages, positive and negative externalities and institutional arrangements related to wildlife damages, damage compensations and resources used to protect either livestock production system or wildlife and allow the classification of damages and compensation systems. Where sufficient quantitative information is available, standardised cost calculations can be applied to characterise the magnitude of damages and damage compensations. For synthesising best practices of livestock farming and wildlife management, standardised operating protocols (SOP) for data collection will be developed. The SOPs will ensure that data will be collected by using the same metrics, or in the absence of same metrics, the SOPs will enable sufficient information to convert the datasets into a harmonised inventory of data. \n",

      "## Step 2 - Upgrading (Local-Level) Cohabitation In Ncczs\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of the second step is to develop and improve Tools, Technologies, and Management processes (TTM) \n",
      "for enhanced cohabitation between agriculture, wildlife, and wider stakeholder groups in society. To do so, this step builds on **the Living Lab (LL) method**: open innovation ecosystems in real-life environments using iterative feedback processes throughout a lifecycle approach of an innovation to create sustainable impact43. In this context, living labs operate as intermediaries/orchestrators among citizens, research organisations, companies (farmer Page 11 communities in our case) and government agencies/levels. Step 2 of the project's methodology sets up and leverages 10 Living Labs (please see a detailed description of each LL below) in the NCCZs selected for this project. Each LL is followed throughout their running period by a multistakeholder team of researchers from the different academic disciplines represented in the consortium, wildlife conservation, and farming sector stakeholders, whose competences combine to identify and assess the human as well as organizational factors shaping the effective adoption and implementation of tools, technologies, and management processes (TTM). The TTM implemented and assessed in this second step vary across the respective LLs, due to differences in each LL's socio-cultural, economic, geographical, and biological characteristics. The complex systems thinking framework, which fosters the integration of biological, economic, and social science-humanities disciplines, allows this step to adequately consider the biophysical and socio-economic and policy contexts in which the limitations to livestock production and to conservation of wild species occur. The formative concept of **coupled** social-ecological systems offers an integrative framework in this step, and takes into consideration biophysical processes, such as wild species biology and livestock production, and their associated social actors (farmers, technicians, social groups) and institutions (policy makers, norms, rules).\n",
      "\n",
      "Decisions relative to the combination of implemented TTMs adequate for the respective contexts will be taken in concert with local stakeholders. In each LL, social science approaches with a combination of deliberative research, surveys and monitoring methods are used to analyse the motivations and drivers behind them to inform strategies for securing farming continuity and long-term provision of public goods, specifically conservation of wild species. In addition to the quantitative and qualitative tools used for monitoring TTM implementation in the LLs, the TTM \n",
      "assessment includes a **participatory cost/benefits analysis (CBA)** of current and new farming strategies that preserve, protect, and valorise wildlife (e.g., large carnivores and ungulates) and pastoralism and thus enhance cohabitation, taking into consideration farmers' role and challenges on their livelihoods. Following the LLs across the project's running period, the participatory CBA integrates the novel findings emerging in the LLs relative to TTM\n",
      "to iteratively update the direct and indirect, intended, and unintended, short, and long-term, quantifiable and unquantifiable, tangible and intangible, certain and probabilistic, internal and external costs and benefits of preserving, protecting and valorising wildlife and pastoralism at the level of LLs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Agropastoral systems contribute to provide a variety of ecosystem services, and the damages occasioned by LCs can cause the abandonment of marginal areas and a consequent loss of services. Based on the LLs, a GIS (geographic information system) analysis will be performed to identify the environmental value of the land managed by the farms; different scenarios will be produced according to the solution proposed by the LL and by literature review. A \n",
      "consequential Life Cycle Analysis **(LCA)** approach will be implemented to explore the potential effects of the different scenarios in terms of provisioning and non-provisioning ecosystem services. \n",
      "\n",
      "This step further involves developing and testing **a Digital Twin (DT) modelling prototype** in the LLs, allowing for combining prediction models with real-time data. Widely used in engineering and construction, the adoption of Digital Twin technology in conservation is still in its infancy but has been successfully adopted for biodiversity conservation when monitoring animal migration. Improving and extending this technology into the context of humanwildlife encounters constitutes a promising avenue for ensuring real-time data collection and monitoring. Exploring the technology's potential for citizen science data collection, the project ensures local but also potentially crossborder multi-actor involvement in ensuring successful agriculture-carnivore cohabitation. \n",
      "\n",
      "In order to improve the adoption and implementation of the chosen TTM in the longer run, step 2 not only develops and improves innovative TTM, but embeds them **in participative, dialogical co-learning methods supporting** \n",
      "the paradigm-shift from conflict to cohabitation among local and regional stakeholders. These methods leverage and support the LLs as multi-stakeholder spaces of co-decision, co-design, co-implementation, and participatory assessment where farmers' group and shepherds have a central role in dialogue with other stakeholders. Field experts from governmental and non-governmental conservation and nature management organizations as well as grass-roots agroecology educators collaborate with the project's academic partners to develop, implement, and improve these co-learning methods. Challenges to translating the cohabitation paradigm linguistically and also in terms of implementation may arise, some stakeholders potentially misunderstanding the concept of cohabitation as a romantic notion of peaceful, damage-free coexistence. It may also be challenging to translate stakeholders' experiences, knowledges and existing strategies that have been long embedded in a worldview of \"ownership\" and top-down \"management\" of land and livestock, and wildlife as a factor that comes to conflict with human needs into an alternative paradigm of cohabitation. To address this challenge, this project builds on \n",

Damage is low but is  expected to increase as wolf populations stabilise.  There is considerable concern and opposition to wolf  expansion from the farming and the political spheres. Current wildlife management - mitigation measures - and effectiveness: Fences in some  grazing and forage areas. Compensation from regional government. Key ecosystem services affected (socio-economic, environmental, cultural and political  benefits): Rejection of wolf by rural communities dependent on sheep in marginal areas with  few alternatives; Sheep farms and numbers decreasing sharply in last years; Wolf can help  regulating the population of wild boars and rabbits (damage in crops and zoonosis control).  Potential conflicts between stakeholders. INNOVATION: LL management approaches - mitigation measures (good practices and  infrastructures at farms and regional levels, within a wider wildlife management  approach): The LL in Aragón will a) study the suitability of a range of available conservation  measures to the agricultural context, b) train community leader farmers (15-20) with a  particular focus on farmer-to-farmer training and exchange of experience with other Spanish  regions, and c) establish a regional think tank composed of people from different sectors and  entities in the region related to the conflict between extensive livestock farming and the wolf.

Hunting is a large business, important for rural  economies. A growing tourism industry around wolves exists. Conflicts between stakeholders  (within rural and rural-urban communities).  INNOVATION: LL management approaches - mitigation measures (good practices and  infrastructures at farms and regional levels, within a wider wildlife management  approach): The LL in Ávila45 will be led by AECRANI. It will use 6-8 pilot farms to analyse  the factors that influence the success of a range of protection measures currently used by  farmers. It will also test the potential of GPS collars on extensive farms to warn of wolf  attacks, to locate dead animals in rangelands, and to prove that attacks have taken place when  no other evidence is available.

Sporadic predation of at least  two wolf packs and individual wolves in lower and higher  Alpine area. Occasional presence of brown bear. Animals  are typically grazed with little supervision, with breeders  only visiting their livestock every week or less.  Current wildlife management - mitigation measures - and effectiveness:  Pre-Alpine: Technical (multi-wire electric fences, lower electric nettings (less than 120 cm),  a few farmers use high electric nettings), lethal (removal of conflict individuals). Effective  protective measures as high electric nettings not always affective (steep terrain, rocky ground,  snow, etc.). Alpine: little to no protection. Legal: compensation from government only if  protected species is proven to have caused damage. Key ecosystem services affected (socio-economic, environmental, cultural, and political  benefits): Human tolerance towards wolf is very low, especially among farmers. Sheep  farmers are discontinuing their practices. Bringing back traditional practices of protecting  livestock in higher Alpine area is needed - shepherds in combination with alternative  practices.

INNOVATION: LL management approaches - mitigation measures (good practices and  infrastructures at farms and regional levels, within a wider wildlife management  approach): Demonstrating / testing concrete measures at the farm & surrounding: setting up  more efficient electric fences, testing of light and sound deterrents, radio-telemetry research  on wolf to study behavioural / predation patterns. Improved planning and implementation of  preventive measures to protect livestock. LIVING LAB 9 - Paneveggio Pale San Martino Natural Park Main  stakeholders: Farmers and  farmers'  associations,  farming advisory  service, provincial  wildlife  management  service and  protected areas,  local  administrators,  tourist operators,  natural park  Paneveggio Pale  San Martino  Natural Park,  Autonomous  Province of  Trento, Breeders  association,  scientists  Country: Italy Geographic  area: Paneveggio  Pale San Martino  Natural Park (NE  Italian Alps) Focus wildlife:  Wolf, bear Agro-pastoral/outdoor livestock farming  system: Dairy and sheep farming. Approximately  two-hundred farmers, half full-time (dairy,  associated to a local cooperative milk processing  chain) and half part-time (mostly sheep  smallholders). Dairy cattle mostly grazing  outdoor in summer, sheep also throughout the  year. Still present the cultural heritage associated  with livestock farming.  Conflicts in the management of farming  systems and natural resources:  Livestock farming systems experienced a strong decline in the last decades, which has  resulted into a loss of grassland areas important for Ecosystem services (see below). Recent  arrival of wolves exerts further pressure on farms and has resulted in predation events, mostly  on sheep, and the need to protect also young cattle during outdoor periods in high-elevation  summer pastures. Part-time farmers quitting sheep farming, or reducing flocks' size and  grassland management, due to the conflict.  Current wildlife management - mitigation measures - and effectiveness:  Electrified nets and night enclosure have been implemented by some farmers. Guardian dogs  are considered unsuitable due to conflicts with tourism. Effectiveness of measures lacks  proper assessment. Farmers are compensated for acquisition of measures, but not for their  management. Damaged are refunded if measures are implemented.  Key ecosystem services affected (socio-economic, environmental, cultural, and political  benefits): The diversity of existing farming systems is complementary to the conservation of  grassland resources, local economy and touristic appeal, social cohesion, cultural landscape  and heritage, and biodiversity. Conflicts between stakeholders (within rural and rural-urban  communities).  INNOVATION: LL management approaches - mitigation measures (good practices and  infrastructures at farms and regional levels, within a wider wildlife management  approach): Social and policy (participatory processes); farm management; implementation of farmtailored prevention measures; remote monitoring; awareness campaigns; educational.

      "scenario-based way. Step 3 delineates 4-6 scenarios differing based on the following factors which we draw from existing research, and which the project's empirical work will supplement with additional relevant factors. Current factors include type and average sizes of local farming systems, local stakeholders' individual attitudes towards (cohabitation with) LCs, cultural images and narratives about LCs, human and LC population density, political and legal frameworks for TTM.

      "In view of optimizing TTM on the European level, the project aggregates the scenario-based TTM recommendations to the European level in two ways supporting the replicability of the LLs optimization practices and methods across Europe and beyond: (1) where appropriate, step 3 identifies commonalities in appropriate TTM\n",
      "across scenarios which can form the basis of European level policy and decision-making and (2) step 3 develops and details methods and processes which can be implemented across Europe for identifying which scenario a NCCZ in Europe most closely resembles, and on this basis, which combinations of TTM tools and practices are the most likely fit with the NCCZ in question. This step also assesses the extent to which context-based models' and CBAs' ability or inability to capture differences across stakeholders' values affects regional, national, and European-level policy decisions. A possible challenge relative to the latter assessment lies in insufficient or inadequate data emerging from the LL contexts to allow meaningful, broader-level sensitivity analyses. The project will address such a challenge through periodic assessments of data quality and quantity gathered in the LLs, and if necessary, engage in the collection of additional data beyond the LL contexts. Combining these elements with steps 1 & 2, step 3 formulates policy- and decision-making recommendations to enhance cohabitation in NCCZs across Europe. In addition to a best practices inventory for TTM in NCCZs, the recommendations detail processes, protocols, and methods for (a) harmonizing data collection and conflict monitoring, (b) enhanced **co-decision & co-learning processes in NCCZs,** (c) **local-level environmentally and** \n",

      "The project's overall research approach, methodologies, and intended outcomes have strong linkages to equity and inclusivity with regards to gender and sexuality. The relational research approach and methodologies the project uses consider the *situatedness46* of human actors, emphasizes the role of gender and sexuality - as well as other relevant sociological dimensions, such as race/ethnicity, migration histories, and socio-economic class, (dis)abilities - in experiencing and shaping relationships, action possibilities, and ways of seeing, perceiving, 'knowing', and ultimately also shaping the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "The project takes into account that the movement of people, particularly young and educated individuals, from rural to urban areas; as well as influx of migrant workers into agricultural areas, can lead to changes in the demographic and socio-economic structure of rural communities. This can have implications for gender roles and relations, as well as for the viability of agricultural and pastoral practices. Gender equality is often seen as a cornerstone of rural development, with the empowerment of rural women being a key tool to protect and rejuvenate rural communities. Women living in rural areas have frequently been depicted - and therefore also responsibilized - as the primary drivers of rural sustainability. In 2000, promoting gender equality became an official goal of the Rural Development Programme (RDP), regulated through gender mainstreaming, and evaluated in the formal Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) evaluation rounds. The CAP remains the largest European policy, which emphasises the need for it to 46 Haraway, Donna. 1988.

      "promote gender equality. However, research also indicates that while progressive policies and changing societal dynamics have led to some changes in women's participation in the agropastoral work environments, gendered spatial segregations and division of labour remain common in farming47 in ways that reflect the deep embeddedness of gendered myths and stereotypes related to agriculture as well as wildlife conflict. Many gender-oriented agropastoral policies and initiatives, while intending to promote women's participation, take approaches to gender that exclude the experiences, challenges as well as situated expertise of individuals whose gender identities and sexualities fall outside the heteronormative social order48. Identifying and addressing barriers to cohabitation in agropastoral settings will benefit from better understanding the situated experiences of stakeholders in a way that represents the spectrum of gender and sexuality that are observed and intersect with other sociological dimensions in societies today49. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our approach therefore takes into consideration the gendered dimensions of knowledge, experience, and expertise in agropastoral life as well as with wildlife encounters; in identifying problems as well as developing and coordinating solutions towards cohabitation amongst (and within) species. We further contribute to the state-of-the-art in the research landscape by attending to an inclusive spectrum of gendered experiences in the agropastoral field. \n",

The best practice inventory is based on a harmonized database containing wildlife management approaches, number, and most common types of damages by region and carnivore (KER3).

EO3: Decision-making process on wildlife management and land planning participated by relevant stakeholders Drawing on CRITTER's participatory, multi-stakeholder methodology, this project develops and improves methods for implementing decision-making processes on wildlife management and broader land planning in NCCZs that draws on continued participation by but also co-learning of stakeholders such as farmers, hunters and local (non)governmental conservation actors (TG 1-4) (KER4).

      "\n",
      "## Contribution To Expected Impacts (Eis) - **Enable Sustainable Farming Systems That:** Ei1: Provide Consumers With Affordable, Safe, Healthy, **And Sustainable Food**\n",
      "\n",
      "Small-scale farming and herding organizations are crucial for the maintenance of traditional ways of producing food \n",
      "(e.g., cheese, meat, cereals) more in line with nature and seasonality (e.g., cheese produced using local milk and natural bacteria cultures). The risk of losing animals because of predators is a cost that impairs economic competitiveness of farming in regions where LC are present. This project will be conducive to farms becoming more resilient especially towards risks caused by LC, but also ungulates. CRITTER's particular focus on developing and improving TTM that are economically and practically feasible to implement by small-scale farmers (TG1) contributes to the economic sustainability of traditional grassland-based farms, ultimately benefiting consumers. The project will strengthen the capacity of organic, traditional and agropastoral farming systems to produce meat and dairy products in a sustainable manner especially in rural, mountainous, and other less favourable areas. Most directly, this project details feasible solutions to reduce damages in livestock-wildlife encounters (SO2&3), thereby reducing economic and motivational pressures favouring livestock farming abandonment and increasing local food provisioning security for consumers. Reduced risk of wildlife damages also improves economic viability of farming and reduce costs for farmers to supply their products at a more competitive price, such as artisanal products, hence making them more affordable to consumers as well. Finally, the project's promotion of a cohabitation-focused approach to farmers' relationship with large carnivores (KER4) can facilitate farmers' promotion of their products in terms of extrinsic quality attributes (quality characteristics dependent on the production systems, not the product), \n",
      "which responds to consumers' sustainability concerns in terms of biodiversity and animal welfare. EI2: increase the provision of ecosystem services CRITTER's specific focus on enhancing cohabitation between multiple stakeholders in NCCZs contributes to the provision of ecosystem services in several respects. Feasible solutions to reduce damages in the encounter between livestock and wildlife (SO2) and enhance cohabitation between agriculture and LCs can contribute to the conservation of high nature-value farmlands by maintaining grassland in marginal geographical areas, with positive effects in terms of cultural, regulating, and supporting ecosystem services. **Cultural ecosystem services** then arise in terms of better mental and physical health among others for local population (reduced fear, higher well-being in nature) and tourists (TG 12) but crucially also farmers (TG1) who face risk of damages to livelihood and even family, caused by predators and ungulates. Better TTM reduces farmers stress relative to workload and livelihood preservation and equally important the quality of life of the family, and the psychological health or status of the farmers and family members, reducing mental load (e.g. nights without sleep, care for their animals, etc.). The NC2 modules (KER4) facilitating cohabitation using art-based and story-telling techniques provide cultural ecosystem services for farmers and local population (TG1 & 12) in terms of their aesthetic and spiritual benefits, which allow for a reimagination of human relationships with large carnivores. Attractive and safe touristic landscapes where local stakeholders are protectors of and advocates for local biodiversity (also induced by KER4) offer cultural ecosystem services in terms of recreation and tourism for locals and tourists (TG12). The project contributes to regulating ecosystem services by developing and improving TTM that lower large carnivores' access to livestock animals, inducing them to feed increasingly on other wildlife and hence benefiting control of population dynamics among wild boards, deer and rabbits that cause large losses in crops (beneficial also to agriculture farmers) or control of zoonosis and other animal diseases such as African swine fever with important economic consequences \n",
      "(beneficial to society at large and farmers). **Supporting ecosystem services.** Perennial grasslands have been found to be an efficient way of sequestering carbon when compared to cereals cultivated one year only. Additionally, as grasslands are typically covered by vegetation throughout the year, agro-pastoral systems are an efficient means of mitigation erosion and flooding on agricultural land. Inclusion of grasslands in crop rotation can also help in combatting pests and crop diseases, when compared to monocultures of cereals. EI3: restore and strengthen biodiversity Apex predators like the bear and wolf have profound effects on ecosystems, as they control the populations of smaller predators, herbivores, and plants, and are capable of self-regulation. They are central to the functioning of ecosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity (TG11). The project's aims of reducing illegal killing and preventing attacks on domestic animals through optimized TTM (SO2) can thereby contribute to higher success rates in the restoration and strengthening of biodiversity. Furthermore, the project promotes the conservation of livestock genetic resources, as local breeds/populations are maintained by small-scale farming systems, which the project and its results benefit (TG1). Additionally, agro-pastoral systems (especially with perennial grasslands) have multiple benefits in terms of promoting biodiversity in farmed areas when compared to cereal-based farming, especially monocultures of cereals. As the project creates enabling conditions for pasturebased livestock farming, it will lead to increased biodiversity in farming areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "EI4: foster plant, animal, *and public health* Large carnivores have a beneficial impact on landscapes and ecosystems, among others in respect to grazing and fertilization patterns of large grazers (wider distribution of grazing spaces with advantages among others for plant health). Especially ungulates can transmit zoonotic pathogens either through human-wildlife contacts or contaminations occurring via non-timber forestry products such as berries or mushrooms, as well as transmission of zoonoses via farmed animals to food and humans (TG 11 & 12). Improved control of wildlife populations will thus mitigate the risks of zoonotic diseases for humans as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "EI5: improve animal welfare Better prevention of contact between livestock and large carnivores (SO2) leads to improve livestock (TG 10) \n",
      "welfare. Depredation, a fatal event for involved livestock, also significantly affect the welfare of the surviving animals as it induces stress and fear among livestock. As such, preventing depredation improves livestock welfare in two areas (Freedom from pain, injury, or disease; Freedom from fear and distress) of the five defined by the European Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming. Abortions, loss of lactation, fear, agony, and stress are common in sheep and goat herds after the attack of the large carnivores, which are detrimental in terms of animal welfare and ultimately result in (typically not compensated) economic damage to farmers. Reduced illegal killing of large carnivores not only prevents the loss of individuals but counteracts the negative effects of uncontrolled removal of wolves. Contrary to authorized culling, uncontrolled (illegal) killing of wolves often demolishes the social structure of the wolf packs and can lead to problematic wolf behaviour when dispersed members of the pack are no longer capable of organised hunt of the wild prey and might start preying on the less demanding, often under-protected livestock.\n",
      "\n",
      "EI6: generate fair economic returns for farmers Damages and associated expenses or lack of income represent an overmeasurate burden especially for small-scale farming systems (TG1). This relates not only to direct costs, but also loss of income, excessive use of time resources on prevention and changes in livestock/grazing management. Better mitigation of LC damages among livestock reduces the risk of farmers losing their valuable animals and even more valuable breeding stock, which may have been accumulated over several years of breeding effort. It also helps to mitigate damage caused to farms infrastructures such as fences or light-structured animal shelters. As these losses are not only related to the loss of value of animals and property but also to the loss of income-generating potential, the project will support economic viability and income generation among farmers. By offering feasible solutions to reduce damages resulting from the encounter of livestock and wildlife (SO2&3) as explained above, this project reduces economic and motivational pressures favouring livestock farming abandonment. Furthermore, a cohabitation focused approach to the encounter between agriculture and large carnivores, facilitated by the project's NC2 modules (KER4), opens new business opportunities for touristic services or the production and marketing of products (e.g. meat or cheese), which contributes to species conservation. Finally, the project's participatory cost-benefit analysis (SO3) assessing current and new farming strategies that preserve, protect, and valorise wildlife and pastoralism provide indications for fairer compensation and incentive measures in agricultural policies (KER7, SO5). \n",

      "CRITTER contributes to existing scientific knowledge within specific disciplines but also on an interdisciplinary level. The scientific community will benefit from the project generating new datasets and knowledge about the efficacy of TTM enhancing cohabitation between wildlife and agropastoral farming (SO1). Harmonising data collection approaches (KER2) and datasets (KER3) will enable the scientific community to better compare the results across countries and studies. Reviews conducted by WP1 will provide state of the art knowledge to scientists enabling future research projects (KER1, KER3). Not only developing and improving TTM in the LLs but embedding them in participatory co-learning processes (SO2) advances existing research in the AAR discipline both in terms of TTM methodology and in terms of opening up for a new epistemological approach to the field. The overarching SSH-based theoretical framework guiding intradisciplinary development throughout the project adds new linkages between especially natural scientific and social scientific academic disciplines which for the most part still tend to evolve in parallel instead of together. By providing a 'context of contexts'50, the SSH-based contribution to combining disciplines coincides with a practical and practicable combination of methodologies in rural communities and NCCZ. The synthesis and comparison of modelling frameworks for TTM scenarios offers a crucial overview of existing field-level approaches allowing an aggregation building on - and applicability relevant for - various local and regional specific conditions (KER6). The broadened applicability of the Digital Twin technology not only in conservation but at the point of encounter between agriculture and LCs contributes to the scientific developing of this technology along with further heightening its societal impact. The combination of a field-level participatory CBA with an aggregating sensitivity analysis brings together two complementary methodological approaches in an innovative way, bridging bottom-up participatory methods and large-scale resource economic analyses. \n",

In addition, the results of the project, especially knowledge about the perspectives of farmers and the experience of the living lab will be relevant study modules in existing agricultural high-school programmes, defining the basis for the understanding of values, perspectives, and narratives of the future stakeholders. The project's theoretical framework integrating the field of Multispecies Relations Studies with agricultural and natural resource management fields constitutes an ideal opportunity for the development of multispecies management and conservation study modules for incorporation in existing agricultural or conservation study programmes - with the prospects of developing an interdisciplinary, international study programme on multispecies management and conservation comporting theoretical modules drawing from the disciplines represented in this project as well as practical modules of study and work in the field, among farmers and/or conservationists.

But achieving these ambitious goals presents challenges, notably in rural areas where conflicts between local communities and large carnivores persist.\n",
      "\n",
      "CRITTER will contribute to strengthen rural resilience and thus support Europe in bolstering its rural communities, which play a significant role in the bioeconomy in the EU. The bioeconomy in the EU has annual turnover of €2.2 trillion euro and employs around 17.5 million people. The whole agri-food chain represents 75% of the employment in the EU's bioeconomy and accounts for two-thirds of its turnover,56 and although the agri-food chain represents a lot more than just the economy of rural communities, rural areas are home of approximately 30% of the European population.57 Additionally, rural areas account for 43.8% of beds in tourism accommodation across the EU and witness 37% of all nights spent by tourists, highlighting their attractiveness as destinations.58 Rural tourism contributes to the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of rural areas, and safeguards small-scale farming, addresses social inequalities, and creates employment opportunities, especially for women, as recognised by the European Parliament,59 which also stresses the point, that Europe's rich rural heritage generates revenue through ecotourism, guided tours, and recreational activities. Rural communities are thus a vital component of the EU's economy, fostering sustainable development, preserving cultural heritage, and supporting local livelihoods. \n",
      "\n",
      "The **primary benefit** of CRITTER will be reducing human-wildlife conflicts and enhancing co-habitation by implementing effective conflict resolution measures, which can save tens of millions of euros by minimizing livestock losses. Additionally reducing such conflicts will have **secondary benefits** to both the bioeconomy and tourism sector within the EU. These sectors, as explained above, are massive sectors of strategic and primary importance to the EU and sectors where rural communities play a pivotal role. Since the size of these sectors are so large, one easily can project a benefit of billion+ euros, even from a benefit of 1‰ due to peace of mind, reduced conflict, increased quality of life and increased social coherence in rural areas. Therefore, we highlight how CRITTER will positively affect these two huge sectors of strategic importance to the EU. Finally, a successful implementation of CRITTER can lead to more efficient human-wildlife management systems **outside of Europe**, which can relieve pressure on the global agricultural production, alleviate food insecurity and increase productivity among farmers.60\n",

      "## Barriers\n",
      "\n",
      "CRITTER has identified and addresses the following barriers that can challenge to what degree the expected outcomes and impacts will be successfully achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "BARRIER CRITTER **MITIGATION STRATEGY**\n",
      "Local political resistance. Local administrators in rural and mountain areas may show reluctance towards European-level implementation of common methods & processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "CRITTER's co-learning tools and methods are designed to be adapted to help governmental actors muster political support from local constituencies. Furthermore, governmental actors in the living lab regions will actively participate in the incorporation of policy advice, allowing them to get involved in cross-border decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inadequate involvement of local stakeholder so that they are reluctant to adopt proposed best practices. A similar barrier can arise from traditional approaches towards and perceptions of large carnivores and wildlife in general in different geographical areas, between rural-urban contexts and between categories of stakeholders, which can lead to misinterpretations and reluctancy in accepting the proposed tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "CRITTER's LLs and multi-actor approach has close interaction with stakeholders at its core and designed to build trust and mutual understanding between stakeholders, seeding fertile ground for adopting the best practices. By safeguarding participation of local actors and hearing and valuing the voice of each participant in the LLs regions, CRITTER will ensure the development of tools and policy advice adapted to the interests and needs of all the main stakeholders. This will further stimulate the adoption of project's solutions by stakeholders beyond the LLs in a long-term strategy of enhanced cohabitation across European NCCZs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farmer resistance. Farmers are reluctant to accept the predators' presence and be involved in conflict mitigation projects as actors and not simply as beneficiaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The participation of farmers and their organisations will be fostered by the participative and bottom-up methods which CRITTER makes accessible via the NC2 Hub, with the support of agricultural and animal science expert of CRITTER.\n",
      "\n",
      "Logistical, technological, **and competencerelated barriers** may hinder wide-ranging adoption of the proposed technologies, including need for mobile coverage, cameras that might not be suitable for in the local terrain, lack of people in the local area competences to install / operate / monitor the recommended TTM.\n",
      "\n",
      "CRITTER's continuous collaborative work with diverse stakeholders ensures the identification of specific challenging cases and, thus, finding appropriate solutions to be put in practice in the short and medium-long term. Such solutions will be incorporated in the NatureCulture Collaborative NC2 Hub, as part of the informative pillar, for future usability in similar cases across other regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Language & culture/mentality of actors across European contact zones. The linguistic barrier can be perceived at two different levels: 1. Domestically, where local people use a different language and/or domain-specific vocabulary than the one spoken by external actors (researchers, conservationists). 2. Intercountry, when a clear communication in a common language like English (not spoken everywhere in Europe) is essential for Where different languages are concerned, we will leverage on the presence of bilingual individuals (this could be the case of LLs in Finland and Spain), multilingual documentation (e.g., presentations, reports, and platform contents), and digital translating tools. In relation to domain-specific vocabularies, a sharable list of key concepts will help understanding technical terms and expressions across different fields beyond the project period. \n",

Open access to some of these tangible outputs in the NC2 Hub will enable actors in the wider agro-pastoral sector across Europe to exploit the project's results in their territory and agricultural practices, enabling socio-economic and cultural return in local communities and society in general. The exploitation plan will consist of the following actions:\n",
      "Create synergies and encourage up-take of the solutions by presenting project outputs at events, meetings and conferences - **Build a network of stakeholders**, CRITTER raises awareness of the project and promotes the NC2 Hub as key to ensure the sustainability and application of project learnings even beyond the funding period. This will encourage stakeholders to join the network, promote it further with their own networks, and build on these, create a ripple effect - **Sustainability of the partnership:** To ensure the sustainability of the consortium partnership internally and with its stakeholders, CRITTER will define a governance model and action plan not only to advance the project's outputs but to create an environment that will help foster new forms of open research and innovation partnerships and value chains across sectors, disciplines & geographical regions - **Implementation of the R&I Agenda**: Targeted networking with research funding agencies and EC bodies will ensure the that the CRITTER R&I Agenda - or parts of it - will be taken up and implemented by these bodies. In the long-term, this exploitation plan will be conducive to locals being more prone to stay in rural areas that have the possibility to develop tourism sustainably with positive repercussions in the local economy and environment. The increased communication and coordination among stakeholders at local, national, and European level facilitated by the NC2 Hub will generate ease of access to information and possibly less bureaucracy for farmers, administrators, and conservationists, saving money in the long-term. \n",

Such an approach is more likely to be accepted by the local society and are better adapted to local conditions in NCCZS where reducing the negative outcomes of encounters between agriculture and LCs largely depends on multi-sectorial collaborations to develop strategies that reduce the cost of predation, increasing the cost-effectiveness of productive activities in rural communities, and creating suitable landscapes for large carnivores, particularly in areas that surround protected and wilderness areas. The co-decision process and method develops in three steps: \n",
      "Step 1: co-design a list of all options of mitigation measures for each specific LL on the basis of the results from WP6 by detailing specificities of ecosystems and types of wildlife management approaches. \n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Co-design a list of costs and benefits for each option. R8elevant stakeholders will clarify economic, social, and environmental (and other relevant categories) costs and benefits. Within each category, both one-time and recurring costs and benefits will be identified and controlled to avoid double counting in different categories (e.g. social and economic). \n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Calculate the value of the costs and benefits. This step will require determining the timeline for the analysis and the quantification of costs and benefits for all the categories. There are cases where costs and benefits are not easy to quantify. In this case, a pairwise ranking will be used to rank quantifiable and non-quantifiable costs and benefits. This will allow us to identify where non-quantifiable values lie compared to the quantifiable values. The group will then attribute a monetary value based on the ranking.\n",

To mitigate unwillingness due to the sensitivity of or  polarization related to the topic, we will keep interviewees' identities  confidential and rely on multi-actor facilitation practices from partners' previous work to create trustworthy research relationships. The key participants  we have already identified have been active in public debates on LCs and  ungulates, therefore we expect that they will share data and contribute to the  process.

      "| Difficulty in assessing the  LLs' impact and effectiveness. L=M | S=M WP3  Partners' (e.g. CITA, UNIPD, DEM) extensive experience with LLs mitigates  WP4  this risk as partners have previously adopted this method for innovation  WP5 development and impact. CRITTER will define clear evaluation criteria to use  WP8 across LLs, collect relevant data, and analyse results systematically, both  WP9 qualitatively and quantitatively by drawing on existing literature and practice. Assigning monetary values to  social benefits in cost-benefit  analyses involves subjective  judgment. Different  stakeholders may perceive  these benefits differently,  resulting in varying outcomes. L=M | S=M WP6  The design of the participatory CBA relies on a rigorous process for enabling  WP7  the decision-making process on values entering the analysis, which includes  WP9 systematized provision of guidelines and an iterative process of jointly arriving  at meaningful selection and voting criteria. Close coordination and  collaboration with WPs 1-5 ensure that participants' lifeworlds are understood  from the outset and can constructively be interrogated during the participatory  CBA. An aggregating sensitivity analysis (T 9.2) further mitigates this risk by  investigating how and to what extent values obtained in the participatory  process scale in consequential ways to impact aggregating analyses and  decision-making.  CBA has an inherent risk of  omission when economic  value often extends beyond  financial metrics to intangible  factors like cultural heritage,  making precise valuation  challenging. L=M | S=M WP6  CRITTER brings together experts from across Europe, with a long track record  WP7  in performing cost-benefit analyses in the case of natural resource management  WP9 (i.e. UNIPD, CITA, LUKE, SDU). To inform their work and thereby mitigate  this risk, interdisciplinary feedback on the CBA performed in this project will be included. Specifically, the ethnographic methods used for exploring the  complexity of human-wildlife encounters in NCCZs (T 2.3) as well as the  extensive experience of conservation-focused partners such as WWF-BG and  WWF-SK will ensure that non-financial values are adequately included. The diversity of the tested  modelling approaches is too  extensive to allow combining,  generalising or  operationalising.  L=M | S=L WP8,  The WP8&9-lead will coordinate among quantitative approaches together with  WP9 WP participants to ensure good understanding of what each approach and  institution can do, establish good agreements at the beginning of the project on  \"ownership\" of the work developed together. Regular workshops among WP  participants will facilitate interaction and provide advice on the suitability of  the different tools for decision-making.  #§RSK-MGT-RM§# Table 3.1f: Summary of staff effort Total PM  WP8 WP9 WP 10 WP 11 WP 12 WP 13 WP 14 WP 15 WP1 WP2 WP3 WP4 WP5 WP6 WP 7 per  Participant 1 / SDU 6,5 7,5 2,5 3 6 0 0 0 6 0,3 0,3 0,3 13 13 12 71 2 / UOL 5,5 6,5 3 2,5 5,5 0 0 0 0 0,3 0,3 0,3 0,7 0,7 0,7 26,1 3 / UNIPD 1 1 22 21 19 15 15 15 0,5 0,3 0,3 0,3 0,7 0,7 0,7 98 4 / CITA 1 0,8 9 5 6 1 4 4 9 0,3 0,3 0,3 0,7 0,7 0,7 46,8 5 / WWF-BG 5 5 9,5 5 8,5 0 0 0 12 0,3 0,3 0,3 0,7 0,7 0,7 48 6 / WWF-SK 5 5 6,5 2,5 4 0 0 0 12 0,3 0,3 0,3 0,7 0,7 0,7 38 7 / SFS 3,5 3 10 6 9 0 0 0 6 0,3 0,3 0,3 0,7 0,7 0,7 40 8 / CAMP 1,5 1 3,5 1,5 2,5 0 0 0 0 0,3 0,3 0,3 0,7 0,7 0,7 13 9 / DEM 2 2,5 2,5 1 2 0 0 0 2 0,3 0,3 0,3 0,7 0,7 0,7 15 10 / LUKE 6 4,5 5 3,5 3 3,5 3,5 4,5 5 0,3 0,3 0,3 0,7 0,7 0,7 41,5 11 / INSP 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 16,7 16,7 16,7 0,3 0,3 0,3 51,1 |\n",
